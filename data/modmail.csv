"Zongi as an RL for famecults did overall a decent job. He needs more practice running these though. Would rec he work on his calls. He needs to be more specific and be more in control. Don't allow raiders to disobey you, make sure they know there will be consequences if they do and follow through. If they know they can get away with it of course they will keep doing it. Overall decent experience though.","Hi, we appreciate the feedback. Zongi did just get fame leader so he is still working on improving his calls and will likely continue to work on group control as he runs more. As he mentioned, those runs were his first runs as fame leader so it is to be expected that there will be some growing pains."
Hi I would like to appeal my blacklist in lost halls/osanc I have no recollection of getting blacklisted and am unsure why I am blacklisted so it would be appreciated if an explination was given at the very least,Hello!

someone tell stumped that he needs to text her back,"Thanks for your concern, we will get right on that!"
he's funny and doesn't take himself to seriously. people out here treating rl'ing like a 9-5 grind up the corporate ladder,Thanks for getting back and taking the time to write to us in a positive manner on that note its great to hear he's leaving that positive impact for all raiders in those runs.
stumped is the best rl no kizzy. just a chill guy fr. give him vrl already,"Hey there, thanks for the kind words and glad you enjoyed his runs! "
"Just finished three amazing public fame cults from Stumped's RSA runs, and stingy rl's complain about how their inefficient. Like dood da public grass touchers want to do fame cults too. I'm sure key popper will understand the difference of a vet vs rsa runs efficiency so leave it up to them. This coming from a vet verified btw! Let da pubs fame cult! That is all love yall no hate have beautiful nights",We're glad you had a good experience with stumped's fame cult runs! This info will be passed onto upper staff. Thanks for the feedback.
"I was told we would be running some chill Fungal runs, a relaxing chain. Unfortunately the RL (Mobbstrf) ended up being pretty toxic and elitist. This got to the point he was unnecessarily threatening people with kicks because of reqs, even though it was NOT an exalted run. When one raider died he yelled out ""rest in piss"" 10 times and was laughing. After the boss was done Mobbstrf sat in the funglal cavern boss room looking at the person's realmeye. He was actively seeking for an excuse to flag the guy who died by checking his gear and stats in the graveyard (like what?). I was supposed to pop 2 keys for this chain, but I just could not bring myself to do so. It was a very unfun experience and is not why I buy keys. This has never been my experience in pub halls before so I was disappointed to see this kind of behavior in an RL. I won't be joining any of their runs in the future, just for myself...however I hope this feedback can help change this kind of behavior for other's experiences. Thanks for you time.","Alright, thank you for the feedback. I have forwarded this to the HRL's and it will be dealt with accordingly. As I'm sure you're aware we obviously don't tolerate this kind of behaviour from our leading staff. And I don't blame you for not wanting to pop your keys. I hope this doesn't happen again and that you have a much better rest of your day! If in the future there's any other feedback you wish to inform us about regarding any staff member or instance don't hesitate to let us know, we take our raider's opinions very seriously. Ty again :)"
"An ARL named Mobbstrf is just generally disrespectful toward his raiders. Tells us to be kind and shit while powertripping over raiders.  Talking bout he's tired so he's gonna be more a dipshit rl. I generally like to meet new rls that i've never raided with, but like his personality and behavior is just worst. Like I would rather have bino raiding than him","Hey there, I'm sorry that his attitude made for an unenjoyable run.  Forwarding this to an HRL right now, thank you for your feedback!"
"i had a question about runs done also, it's not being logged even though i've been doing it and my stats all say 0","Hey there, they should be logged once the run is completed thanks for reporting this to us and we will look into it further to make sure that this is fixed. "
"I checked my stats and noticed that almost no runs were tracked. The bot said I only had a 7 cults done despite my trickster being 4/5 speed exaltation, and having some void and nest runs spread across my characters. Is there something I can do to fix this/prevent runs from not being tracked in the future?",We had some issues with the bot recently but moving forward everything should be logged correctly. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.
Do you guys add alts anymore?,"Omg hi Soar, it's Sea!! But yes we do!  Message any online security for help :)"
lost access to other discord will use this one,"Hey there, contact any online security for assistance with migrating the IGN to the new discord account."
is there any way you guys keep track based on rotmg user cause the discord account's been deleted,Hi!  We keep track with Discord accounts because people will more often switch their IGN then their Discord accounts.

"Got muted by Dyno bot for trying to post links in #music-share. Don't care about the mute, only 1h.

how do i reverify ?,You’ve been verified!
well he didnt miss any calls and before we entered the hallways he already knew where a split will be. maybe also a little bit luck cause i dont know how to mapread but was pretty clean. chat was also very hyped,"I see, thanks for taking the extra time to describe what was good about his run. I'll be sure to provide this extra information to the HRLs. Hope you have a nice day :)!"
I reached out to Ray and asked for proof of my pvp in patience and it seems like he has ignored me.,"Hey sometimes staff can be busy, when did you reach out to him?"

Get in contact with mod mail,"Hi there, you have reached modmail. What would you like to notify us about?"
do we still log vials?,"Hi, there thanks for reaching out! We no longer log adding vials to users when they are dropped in a cult. You are free to do what you want with them. But, bringing a vial to a void or a fullskip does grant you early location and some tickets which can be redeemed for more early location on future runs within our server. In the case that you pop a vial in one of these voids or fullskips, we log it as a used vial which can be seen when you run `;stats`. Hope this help you out."
"This is a mmail for  nacnudd, muted his mic out of nowhere and did not make any calls for 80% of the o3 fight resulting in 10+ 8/8 deaths (couldn't capoture all) then bro unmuted like it was nothing and at the end half assed said sorry for your loss and closed the channel immediately after - no idea if his other runs are like this but won't be joining these in the future abbysmal shit","Alright, thank you for the feedback.

Typically I wouldn’t join a big group running into a bazaar as usually that’s a sign of a raid. But feel free to dm him to discuss your suspension.
"Hi, I have a Modmail for OwnUEasy Hosted an apperent no-callouts 03, called to rotate on outer rotates phase in the middle of outer to inner beams.

Please understand that our o3 section is still fairly new and our RLs are still trying to learn calls. We will pass this on to the HRLs. Thank you
"no worries, and no need to reach out to key,  its all good. it was just upsetting not receiving a response from RL as to why but when he let me know the situation it was fine. and thank you for the prompt response","No problem, enjoy raiding with pub halls."
"my previous mod mail ""key kicked me out of mobbstrf's cult for no reason, i reached out to rl and he ignored me. i was in call, i had just joined, no griefing, etc."" may be ignored, mobbstrf reached out and let me know it was a mistake with key.","Thank you for reaching out. It dose seem to be a mistake with the key, we are sorry that you had this negative experience with Pubhalls. I will reach out to the key to see if any further action should be taken"
"we did mbd then went back. i dont think he was doing it on purpose, he just couldnt map read i guess. was taking pretty obvious wrong splits, i just found it obnoxious that he was having a go at raiders for being inefficient while massively slowing the runs down.","Alright, thanks for the clarification. I'll pass this onto the HRL team."
"i want to modmail Rammeke, i asked him multiple time in dm and in dungeon chat if it was going to be a chain and he wasnt answering since he was responding everyone else","Hi there, unfortunately it can be tough for Raid Leaders to read every message that is sent to them and they may forget to respond. Juggling leading, playing the game, chatting and in some cases map reading is a monumental task. We'll let Rammeke know to try to keep an eye out on messages sent to him, but this isn't something that we can enforce or expect our Raid Leaders to do. Hope you understand and sorry for the inconvenience in the matter."
"rl named Ramekke kicked me for rushing halls, even though it wasnt a trl run, also didnt even say to not rush before the key popped","Hi, thanks for reaching out. Sorry to hear you had a negative experience with one of our raid leaders. Generally speaking, it's good practice to ask whether the raid leader is fine with you rushing a void, as most RLs want to practice their map reading and ensure the group safety by limiting crusade and spooky peeks. Hopefully you can understand our position on the matter and sorry for the inconvenience."
"was in Rammekes cult chain and he didnt specify a key to pop which resulted in a double pop. then he got all shitty and passive agressive with raiders for not clearing efficiently enough while he, no word of a lie took us to mbd in every cult we did... they were not fame cults.","Hi there, thanks for reaching out! We're sorry to hear that you had this negative experience with one of our raid leaders. Can you clarify whether he ended up doing MBC instead of the Cultist Hideout for the cults or did he opt to clear to MBD to make the run slower. Any more information you can provide, helps us improve our raids. We will be sure to pass this onto the HRL team. Hope you have a nice day and more positive runs from now on :)."
ban this fool,"Hello! Thanks for letting us know, we'll look into it."

Our devs are currently trying to trouble shoot this issue, so please be patient as we try to fix this!"
I want to put in some positive mod mail for RL Roarkey. Did a super clean void with great calls and perfect timing. Will definitely be trying to join their runs in the future. 🙂,Thank you for taking time to send in positive feedback. We are glad to hear that you enjoy raiding with Pub Halls and hope that future runs keep up the quality.  We will be sure to let HRLs know of the good experience.
"Unfortunately I do not remember the exact run but it was about two nights ago, the RL thanked me in VC but its nbd if it didn't get logged, I'll just be sure to check it next time.",No worries! We'll get that sorted. Thanks for reaching out!
"Hi there, are stats not updating on the bot? And if so is there any good way to track my void completions for once I get 100? I also noticed my vial pop isn't there either","Yes, at the moment the bot has an issue with tracking void completions. It is in the process of being fixed, but as of now we have to manually verify those using screenshots of exaltations and/or completions for alive players if you are trying to get veteran verification. As for vial pops, those have to be manually logged by staff each run, which run are you referring to where your vial pop didn't get logged?"
"hey, i used tickets to join run that was aborted before start, heard u can do something about this","Yes, I will be giving all tickets back to people"
Freakans made pew pew noises during 12 shotguns goated rl just for that,Thank's for letting us know & we're so happy you had fun :>
"was mistake, I had vial","Hey there, as a Vial or any other priority react you are still required to be in VC whilst raiding, I also highly suggest reading over <#379504881213374475> ."
I really think there should be a limit to how many people can be in the VC early cus its ridicolously stupid when its 80% full before its even opened to people who havent donated,"Hi there, thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately, Fullskips are one of the few runs where that many early reacts are required. To ensure the safety of a fullskip, you need multiple competent tricksters, knights and mystics. In addition to that keys, vials, armor break and scholar's seal. Sorry if you missed the run and hope you can understand our position on the matter. Other types of runs should be more accessible than fullskips are."
"Bro why are my runs not getting logged. At this pace i will never get veteran raider and i will have you know i was a veteran at ""maximum efficiency","Hello, thanks for reaching out! It’s an issue with the bot and it should be fixed in the next couple of days :> If you would like to show 100 completes via exaltations or alive completes, you can also send them to any security."
https://www.realmeye.com/graveyard-summary-of-player/Swellpearz,"Hello! I'm sorry but I can't verify you with that. If you can show 100 completes through exaltations or alive completes, please feel free to reach out to any security :>"

thank you! when applying for veteran would I just have to send screen shots here?,"If you want to manually apply for veteran, simply message any online Security with screenshot proof of 100+ void completes in exalts or alive completes."
"yes, Im not to sure what it should be but I know it freezed because my current wizard has around 15 crystal caverns completed in the server but my stats only show 1 completed","Thank you for letting us know! It should be fixed soon :> In the meantime, you can use alive completes and exaltations to track your progress, and we can accept that as proof for vet verification!"
"I dont believe I have 100 yet the issue is that nothing is counting towards my server progress. I beleive I have all teh boxes checked off, visible in teh social tab, veiwable to everyone on realm eye, and 8/8. Is there anything else I am missing or is this just a bug with the server?","Hello! As long as you are in the vc and raid, it should work. I'm not sure why it's not counting towards completions for you - I've just pulled up your stats and you have 20 void completes with us at the moment. Did it freeze at this number?"
"Hello mods, I am a raider since 2018 and I have had my account viewable to everyone and I have 8/8 characters however my raids are not counting and I am currently trying to get veteran runner. I dont know how long this has been going on for but I just now noticed it. I know for a fact it is incorrect because on my 8/8 ssnl wizard, I have more runs showing as completed in game than I do in here.

hello,"Hi there, you have reached the security team. What would you like to modmail us about today?"
the racist part was like in a o3 yesterday but him refusing to unmute in other peoples runs is like the majority of the runs he is in,I'll assume you mean mute which is not okay.
"sorry i dont have a clipping software but im sure some of the other staff in vc heard,  i dont recall who exactly though :///",Was thhis his most recent run?
RainFallen goated; promote to RL ASAP. Top tier runs.,"We're so happy that you had a great experience with him! Thank you for letting us know, could you elaborate on which parts of the run you enjoyed? If not, that's fine too, we'll forward your feedback to the HRLs :>"
RainFallen is unmatched. Dedicated to teamwork and promoting a respectful and inclusive environment. He is a great role model and I believe we need more leaders like him in our lives.,"We're so happy that you had a great experience with him! Thank you for letting us know, we'll forward this to the HRLs :>"
for vc-less o3 I pressed the support button but got no loc even after the join button was available the bot said that i already reacted and joined the run and still the bot did not send any loc of the run i messaged the raid leader to get loc pls investigate this issue ty,"Sounds a glitch but we’ll let our devs know so they can look into it, I know the VC-less runs are a work in progress so sorry for that experience!"
"during the first phase it is pretty much every rl that calls out ignore minions, shoot boss only if it's before the 2 split. but  on the most recent run i got stranded alone with 2 big boys and several medium boys, and it was on a 4 split platform so i had to nexus. the rl was Mobbstrf","Alright, thanks for providing extra information. After the 2-split, RLs should definitely ensure that minions are being properly handled so that no platform has several big boys or medium boys. If you have the names of any other RLs who you noticed doing this, that would be great. But, we will be sure to pass along your feedback on Mobbstrf to the HRL team. Apart from that, hope your future raids are good and have a nice day :)."
"you guys need to change the calls in void to give seriousness to minions i think, every few runs after the beginning phase when splits come in an excessive amount of minions are allowed to grow into medium and potentially big forms... ignore minions is not a good call","Hi there, thanks for reaching out! Do you mind letting us know which RL or RLs are not giving the minion callouts importance like they should? We will be sure to pass this along to the HRLs to make sure minions are adequately called. They are vital to handle to ensure the run progresses safely and smoothly with minimal raider loss, so appreciate your feedback on this matter."
"I want to modmail MakeKills, i asked him to wait like 10 secs to pop the key i grab my character went to server, he could say to me to dot when im there because i lost the dungeon for like 3 seconds","Hi there, thanks for reaching out to us! We appreciate the feedback you've given us, but just want to make sure of the circumstances. Did MakeKills acknowledge that he read your message as there's a possibility he just didn't see it and popped the key. The best way I recommend catching the attention of an RL is DMing them in-game. Any more information in this interaction would help us improve our raids and the server 🙂"
"I just cannot listen to it, and i dont know why","Hi there, thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately, you are experiencing a Discord Glitch, as you are actually in Lounge, not in the AFK VC. This is a glitch where your client-side thinks that it made it into the VC, but server-side you didn't. So, it means you did not make it into the run. I recommend joining a run without being in lounge beforehand to prevent this bug from happening. If you want more information, check the pinned messages in <#378991029186985985> for more details.

"Once again more evidence of him not leading at all. We failed the coin phases and because of that a lot of raiders nexussed because the rl (pipsi) did not follow the coin and just told someone else to do it. He doesn't call guards, we got silenced twice and he didn't even say anything... Other rls have to unmute themselves to start calling so the group stays on track. You can also tell by the rls voice hes fed up with having to intervene. This is pathetic and lost halls shouldn't have rls like that... This is pathetic and lost halls dc shouldn't have rls like that.","We'll forward this to the HRLs, thank you."
Just did an o3 run with Pipsi. Probably my favorite run of all time. 100% room for improvement on the o3 calls but I couldn't stop laughing the entire run. 10/10 would run with him again.,"We're so happy that you had fun! Thank you for letting us know, we'll forward this to the HRLs :>"
"I just have to complain about your rl @pipsi48 (603294790209241108), once again he randomly starts speaking another language in vc, no one enjoys his runs, tells people if someone has a problem with him to leave, mute him, which shouldn't be a consideration since hes an rl and supposed lead the raid and not make everyone mute him... This runs always have to interruped by other rls to keep him on track or calm him down. He also keep reporting me and only me since he knows i modmailed him about the nword and his behavior...",Thank you for letting us know. This is very concerning behavior.

i know what im doing i just wanna vc with my friends while playing realm not listen to your calls man,"Hey! So as outlined in `#raiding-rules` you aren't allowed to crash runs (not being in vc) or deafen, this prevents certain issues that arise from raiders not following the directions of the raid leader. It is understandable you want to to hang out with friends playing realm! This is just not how raids with VC's are organized in this server, if you would like to do so there are VC-less runs in both here and other servers. Does this explain things?

Raid leaders are human too, they deserve to be treated kindly at the very least.","it’s really sweet of you to be concerned about their wellbeing :> we’ll be sure to check in with them as well, thank u again!!"
"more harrassment going on. People being very rude to DragansMum causing him to have to have someone else take over because this guy's ""jokes"" messed him up.",thank you for letting us know! we’ll be sure to reach out to him to get more information :>
"Hello. I would like to put a complaint in on Marshall. I have already DMd pots about most of this but I just want to mail it as well to make everyone aware cause I’m not sure if he is bringing it to higher-ups. I’ll provide a few screenshots here and I will be blacking out the names Cause I don’t wanna throw anyone under the bus, none of the screenshots were leaks from pub halls. These are all DM‘s and or messages from other servers the whole issue with Jung and Marshall in my spooky halls void, me telling Jung what actually happened and him messaging see I think Marshall is clearly aware that I told jung what really happened and he is now witch hunting me in attempts to prevent me from leading in any other server and he is already done so in max eff and I am being told that he’s doing it elsewhere as well.","Hi Bino, it's Sea, I'll DM you^^"
"Anecnoj was a great rl, got me through my first ever void (and i got my first ever white from mbc) give this man all the bread he a king fr fr","congrats on the void complete!! n thank you for letting us know, we'll forward this to the hrls :>"
Cometss is W rl good calls and good runs everytime i did em (ignore other modmail i didnt do anything just put Cometss),"Hey thanks for letting us know, is there anything in particular you enjoyed about his runs? We’ll pass this along thanks."
he's pretty solid on his calls for both MBC and Void and he has good interactions with his raiders,"yay! ty, we'll be sure to let the HRLs know :>"
Hey I was denied and it said to send here if its not accepting me,Hello! Please reach out to any security and they'll be able to help :>
this name is logged into my old account i no longer have,"Hello, reach out to any online security and they will be able to assist you."
"hai i was an arl 1-2 months ago and i stepped down due to busy with getting into college, now i have enough time to play again so i would like to know if i can come back (i was told i can come back within 3 months)","If you were told you could come back within 3 months, feel free to dm any online hrls so they can help you out about getting back"
whats online security,Any user with the `Security` role is what you’re looking for. These users also normally have an * as the prefix in front of their name. Their name is dark blue on the side member list.
"Hello, i lost my previous discord account, please verify me with my new discord account","Hi, please message any online Security for help with your account transferral."
"Jackswift, Drakeno and eso gave me a very interesting lecture about pirate caves and it gave me a white bag 🙂","Hi, thanks for taking the time to reach out! I'm glad to hear that you had this positive experience with our staff members and will be sure to pass this message onto the HRLs. Have a nice day :)!"
eso and Jackswift,Thanks for providing the extra information. Have a nice day!
"Drakeno run fun as fuck, unlike WiId (super boring)","Hi, thanks for taking the time to reach out! I'm glad to hear that you had this positive experience with one of our raid leaders and will be sure to pass this message onto the HRLs. Have a nice day :)!"
"Drakeno missed fungal 75% call, 3 people muted from him and a few others talking way too much about god know's what. Loud obnoxious laughing doesn't help either.","Hi, thanks for taking the time to reach out! I'm sorry that you had this experience with one of our raid leaders and will be sure to pass this message onto the HRLs. If you don't mind, could you also let us know who were the other staff members who were chatting during the run? This will allow us to take the appriopriate action."
i posted proof but dont think bot takes screenshots. i talked over the situation with KingAzamoth. Seems like it was a mistake but slightly annoying since there were no better locs at the time and was there by myself for 10+ mins clearing,"Appreciate the extra information. We received your screenshot, not to worry. This has been forwarded to the HRLs who will handle the situation to make sure it doesn't happen again. Thanks once again for reaching out and have a nice day :)."
please check if loc is taken first before blindly trusting raiders,"Hi, thanks for reaching out! Do you mind providing more information as to what happened? I assume this loc was taken by one of our own raid leaders. If you could let us know when this was and by which raid leader or any additional information, this would help us understand the issue."
idk what account its under,"Hi, please dm any online Security for help with your account transferal!"
he himself seems concerned.. pretty definitive proof haha but do what ya'll feel is right. Much love thanks for runnin the server for so long guys.,Thank you for informing us :> and I'd just like to let you know that I'll be putting a note on his account so we can monitor if we get more reports of him harassing other raiders as well. I hope your next raids are more pleasant & thanks again!
"Hi there, currently in an o3 raid and have one of the raiders being pretty racist to me in pms. Screenshotted it. Yall do sumn bout that or nah...? I aint even provoke it was hella random lol","Hello! We're really sorry that you experienced that in our raids. As it is an exchange between you and that raider privately, we would rather not interfere. I hope that you guys will be able to sort it out, and if that doesn't help, please do consider using /ignore!"
Nacnudd won’t send me nudes,please don’t send them here either ty
"Hello. I don't use raids a lot (prefer solo/friend play) but I've been in the servers for many years. Is there any way I can vouch for a beginner who has experience in bullet hells and no-lifed Realm in the first day, grinded hard and got 8/8 quickly (with my help)? His request was denied in Oryx Sanctuary because new account, he now wanted to try Lost Halls but said it was denied automatically. Thanks.","Hello! You and your friend would need to reach out to OSanc security to get his account unblacklisted first. Once that is done, we can look into verifying your friend :>"
i am maxed in both of those,hello! i will dm you in a second :>
I was suspended but I meet reqs and dont klnow what i did,hellos! it appears that you showed up to a steamworks raid not meeting reqs - you were not maxed in atk and dex.
"yo, i have problem with walllnator, first ever rl that is not worth of listening, 0 calls, shit talking all the time, like ""these knights are bad, do something"" etc. i had to take off my headphones, and when i ask for calls for hardest part of dungeon (its 3 calls in 15 sec) he made fun of me, and said he cant help me with dodging","Hello! We’ll be sure to forward this to the HRLs. Would you happen to have any recordings of this happening? That would be really helpful, but if not then no worries! Thank you for letting us know & I hope your next run goes better :>"
It seemed like Baconyalt instigated it and was for the most part being racist. After a while I think DrChippy may have been saying some words. I can't say for certain but it was constant back and forth between the two,"Hey thank you for all the extra information I am going to DM the RL for the run and ask him for more context and it will be handled accordingly as we really don’t tolerate any type of toxicity in our runs/raids. Thank you for sharing this information, if you wanna provide anymore info DM *Strasz. Thanks again."
Can we get a permaban on Baconeyalt (his main as well) and maybe DrChippy? Constant racism throughout 4 chain kog,"Hey what run was this apart of? and who was the RL during the run? And are you able to provide anymore information as to what happened, if you have more screenshots as well please send them."
change name to Quen,"Hi, use the command ;cn <new name> in bot-commands. This will work if your name history is public on realmeye. If you have any problems feel free to shoot any online Security a dm!"
all good just wanted to report incase future raiders have similar problems love u,thanks! we lov u 2
this bino guy not even calling cult calls he just talking about his anorexic gf whole time 8/8 died because 0 shotgun calls in 2 cults,"Thank you for letting us know, we'll be sure to send this to the HRLs & hope your next run goes better :>"
I dont know why i'm blacklisted??,Hello! It appears that you were originally blacklisted under suspicion of being an alt. I will unblacklist you in a moment and you should be able to verify then :>
for accursed role verification,"Hi, first, this does not meet Accursed verification requirements. I assume you are going for the 30 completes on one character, but this character has only 26. Second of all, the channel states that you should message a Moderator or HRL with proof for verification, not modmail."
"Pipsi shoudlnt run o3 tbh no calls on the couters, instead lots of panic calling of current phase wasn't a nice run got saved by 2 cele. 20/85 completed only. Or just please ask him to not yell, 13 yo screaming random stuff is not fun for anyone","Alright, that's unfortunate. Obviously we don't want this happening again in the future. I'll forward this on to the HRL's, thank you for the feedback."
"whats the rules on deafening in vcs with certain type of roles (e.g., accursed/vet/etc)","In the regular raiding section, nobody is allowed to deafen (the exception being during the realm clear of an o3). In the vet section, the leading VRL will let you know if you are allowed to deafen"
i have no idea why i am black listed. looking to just play realm with my friends,"Hi, a Security will reach out to you in a moment."
"So hey, i was bad player, now i got better, and got better stuff, pls let me plawy with u, i wanna get better items, im ready",Looks like you'll have to contact the security that originally denied your verification which was <@379867465343303690> :) He is asleep rn but will get to you as soon as he can !
can i get a refund on points used for the fame cult roarkey just put up now. I used points before channel was open but i gueess there are crashers,"Hi, thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear that's the case. I'll pass this on to the upper staff to see if we can do anything for you. Just give us a moment."
"yo. just wanted to say that, in contrast to most casual runs I'm in, Excel annunciates his calls very clearly and covers everything relevant to the current portion of the dungeon. I've even learned a few things from his calls that I haven't in other runs, and I feel especially safe with his updates on what is happening / what comes next. I'd definitely love to see them progress from ARL to RL.","Hey there, glad to hear that you're enjoying the runs with Excel aswell as thankyou for your kind words, Ill be sure to pass this information onto our HRL's"
nacnudd gave really good calls for the vc o3 i was just in :> lots of calls and he called them early + calls for gemsbok too??? amazing it felt super safe,ty caro im a big fan
XBino,Thank you for taking the time to inform us and I'll be sure to pass this along to the HRLs! & I hope that your next run goes better :>
"One of the ARL does simply not care enough to actually lead a raid and the ARL looks like he has no idea what he's doing. He doesn't call properly, doesn't know paths to the right destination, he should be demoted asap.",Thank you for letting us know! Would you happen to know which ARL it is?
Was in an XBino run and he screamed as loud as possible when he ran into pots. Should tell us if he plans to break our eardrums so that we could turn him to 1%. Also failed void run 🙂,"Thank you for letting us know, I'll pass it along to the HRLs!"
can u help me verify plss my ign is Plzgivitem,"Hello Pizgivitem, I would love to verify you I am Hihiihfuif. I will be Dming you shortly with the steps."
im not verified  anymore and my account name is somehow verified here,Dm any online security member (blue role) for help
gfhbdjgfhjdfg,"ok, we'll take that into consideration"
"Brand new season, i have no gear...","I totally get the struggle :< We have lowered the requirements to join an exaltation dungeon raid for the start of the season to t11/t4/t12/t4 with maxed atk and dex for this week. These might still be really hard to get at this time, but our priority is to keep runs high quality and safe for everyone! I hope this is understandable and I hope to see you in runs soon :D"
Can I change my name to Megapussi which it is in game,All done!
I left the discord and I'm trying to rejoin,That won't be a problem. A Security will DM you soon with info on reverifying
Literally have never made a modmail in my life but jesus christ how is the staff even tolerable of being in association with him,"Hi, I’m sorry to hear of your bad experience in our runs with xbino, ill be sure to pass along your feedback to our HRL team."
Nope 3rd time I get to be in a pubhalls raid in a row with these mods idk what y'all be telling em but it has to end. Im flabbergasted,Thanks for letting us know
"Hello pubhalls staff can you please tell ur staff to stop modding s-tier lost halls keys with these mods. Its 4x time bad mods waste of gold waste of time. Mods are Wanderer boss, haunted halls 3. Skilled minions 4, Fumble boss 4.",Can you clarify what's going on? Is there a specific staff member encouraging specific mods they want?
how do i do that,"If you look on the member list on the right of your Discord, scroll down until you find someone with the blue Security role and DM them!"
"hey, i used to be verified on this but i had to make a new discord account",Please message any online security and they can help you switch your account!
can i get incontact with a mod,"Hey, what's up?"
im not sure why im black listed but its been like a few years since ive played this game and i wanna get back in to it,"Hi, you should receive a DM from a Security in a minute."
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h_2B_LJQtxHensfok9njcBtgphnfNVFw/view?usp=sharing,I see your concerns and understand how this could be frustrating. 
why have i been blacklisted,"Hi, Kanoin will dm you on Discord in a second."
XBino is the best < 3 dont know why ppl get mad at him. hes funny and makes runs enjoyable.,"Hey there,  Thanks for the kind words and I'm glad to hear you enjoyed the runs with Bino, Ill be sure to pass this onto the HRL team. "
Hey I changed my ign from NigBobby to WarmBobby can i get it switched,"Hey there, head to <#347885015964712970> and type `;cn WarmBobby` and it should change the name for you if your realmeye name history is public."
Xbino is screaming barely making calls talking about drugs and just being generally awful,"Hi, I’m so sorry to hear of your poor raiding experience with Xbino, Ill be sure to pass this along to our HRL team."
yo how the fuck was this under reqs t14 sword t7 seal with mseal,Hey man sorry about that. Currently crucible characters bugs out in the social tab in game and makes it appear as though you are only 6/8 when in actuality you are 8/8. I'll remove the warn sorry about that.
"Hey, I've been verified a couple times before but left last time I quit realm. I've come back and am attempting to reverify, however I can not dm mreyeball to get my password. Is there any way I can manually verify?","Hi! Please make sure to message `/tell MrEyeball password` exactly like that, case-sensitive.  If it has been a while since you played, pming usernames on realm now require you to type the name exactly how it is if you're not in a dungeon together because... Deca.  Hope that works!"
"also bino gives me early loc regardless if i am rushing or not, so how thats a point. him not giving me early loc was because ""there are 52 people in this call""","If you'd like to appeal your suspension further, please take it up with Marshall and XBino, as they were the ones who suspended you.  Unfortunately because we weren't in the run, we have to take their word on what exactly happened."
"if you guys think i broke rules then ill take my suspension, also weird that a different rl suspended me when it was bino's run.","Hello, I just spoke to XBino and Marshall and both said that XBino told you not to rush, and specifically that there was no point to during a void and they didn't give you early loc."
xbino is using griefed keys over regular keys,"Hey there, thanks for letting us know about this I’ll forward this information to our HRL’s and it will be handled accordingly. "
how do i message @379867465343303690,"Hi, their name is ""CF"" in Lost Halls. You can search them up there."
"yes why am i blacklisted i am just trying to verify, it didnt work the first time and you just blacklisted me instead of sending me a new code to put on realmeye?","Hi, please reach out to <@379867465343303690> as they are the one handling your verification."
"Security Caro: Kicked a memeber of staff during void run, and failed mutiple runs on easy dungeons and had to R after kicking incorrect peope who did meet re.","Thank you for letting us know! Would you happen to have recordings or screenshots of her kicking raiders incorrectly? Otherwise, please let us know who was affected so we can get in contact with them. We're really sorry you had such a poor experience and we hope you have a better time in your next runs."
"what steps do I need to take to have my name changed in discord, recently changed my ign to CrimsonDawn, hoping to fix it in here","Hey it’s very easy to do yourself, go to the `#bot-commands` channel, and type `;cn newnamehere`. If this does not work feel free to DM Strasz for further assistance."
i need to switch to another discord account (vznce),hello! you can message any online security and they'll be happy to help you verify on that account :>

Error,"Hi, you have reached modmail.  What can we do for you?"
"wystrian was a very good rl calmly handled a situation in which a raider was saying offensive things in chat and also managed to give good call outs, I made it through shatters on my first attempt thanks to their help","Hi, thank you for your kind words for Wystrian! Ill be sure to pass it along to our hrl team!"
thank you sir/ma'am,No worries! Have a lovely day!
where is the vet verify,"Hi, heres a link to the module where you can vet verify! https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/556930342083362823/738965169606230146"
"Good morning, I have a question regarding name changes. I recently changed my IGN, and was wondering if there is a way to re-verify and update the discord name as well. It seems to be causing some confusion in raids with people thinking I'm a crasher due to the ign name not showing up in the discord call. Thank you for your time.",Of course! You can change your name manually if you go to the bot-commands channel and type ``;cn [newname]``. Optionally you can also DM any online security to help you
"Ayo idk if this is the proper way to mod mail but like that man bino is the best RL. Bro is on crack but it keeps me on my feet, i now have the ability to do any dungeons cause i hear his screams when anything happens. Thank you","Hi! Thank you for your kind words regarding xbino, ill be sure to pass them along to our hrl team!"
"Pots has had me server deafened under the pretense that he does not like me, I wish to be undefeaned so I can put up an AFK for kogbold.",I think you're server deafened for more than that lol
;XBino leaked location but you allready know that i think,Yea everyone makes mistakes and I am sorry if you didn't make it into the run.
This is for hihii,Hi
Thank you.,"Thanks for reaching out! At the time of checking you were not in the voice channel. If this was a mistake then I apologize, you are more than welcome to DM me for further discussion on this matter if you would like."
"Got a longer than usual loadscreen, RL Ax told key wait for 18, and then told him to pop at 15 and i missed cuz of load. seems to have left 3 others behind aswell","Hi, sorry you missed out on the raid. I'll notify the HRL team about this. If you have any additional information you could add about this, please simply send another message to the bot."
I Lost My previous discord account,You can message any online Security and they'll be happy to help you get verified on this account instead
"My suspension time is over, unsuspende me now","Hi there, thanks for reaching out! Sorry for the inconvenience, your suspension has indeed concluded, so you have been manually unsuspended. Have a good time raiding and try not to infringe the rules."
it wasnt left,"Hello this is modmail for Lost Halls, can you please explain what you mean by ""it wasnt left"""
"i mean overall, all im asking is just to make essential calls when the time is needed. no one really cares if rls are fucking around when its just clear but when the time is needed for some calls just make them. thank you for this","I completely understand where you’re coming from, it can be a bit obnoxious to listen to, no worries we will pass this along to those that it matters too and if you have anything else to share please feel free to, thank you for your feedback!"
can xbino actually do calls instead of just fucking around a lot. it's one thing to joke around with raiders but it's another thing to almost get them killed or make them nexus and waste their time. hes not doing any leading wrong just make him tone down the fucking around when some calls need to be made,Thanks for letting us know. I will personally notify the HRL team and they will deal with it accordingly. Is there anything you would like to share with us? Hopefully this doesn't happen anymore.
just reporting the user Shoppet for racism,Thank you for letting us know
yeah ik send it again lmfao,Send what again? In order to appeal you must reach out to conman0003 (*CF)
send verification again,"Hi, you were rejected by conman0003 (*CF) please dm him for more information/questions."
Utahimeee didn't make the right call and got me and others killed during survival,Can you give any additional information? If not that's okay!
"and after i rushed crystal and told him where to go, he lead the group the other way, resulting in half a run not getting tp and blaming me, the rusher. also a lot of weird comments from raiders towards him, feels like he is baiting","Hi, i’m sorry to hear of your poor raiding experience in our runs, i’ll be sure to pass this information along to our HRL team."
Hey there I changed my Discord account - my RotMG account is WhatTheFrick - if I can get reverified on this discord that'd be great,"Hi, please feel free to dm any online Security for assistance in your discord transferal!"
"im not a big max eff fan, i hate the culture around it, but when your rls start shit to raiders who for the most part have stayed silent while you just want to do a fucking run ESPECIALLY when both guys are RLs and you cant exactly ignore them, that's fucking stupid. These guys are trying so hard to act victim when air pushes them, they are no different than any of the max effs guys","Thank you for letting us know, I'll make sure this gets passed on"
"Kuvu based RL, best O3 callouts I've seen with my (very) limited experience. Bro made the callouts good enough to know when to push in and hang back, super fast and super clean run",Thank you for the positive feedback!  We're glad you're enjoying his runs :) We'll send this along to an HRL too!
"I literally just got unsuspended this is fking bullshit, it's like a 40 dps difference","Be that as it may, the line needs to be drawn somewhere. If you make an exception for T11 because it's so close to T12, then you have T10 which is so close to T11, T9 is close to T10, and so on and so forth. The reqs have been set for T12 with no exceptions"
"I was 7/8, with a t11,t5,t12,and ut ring","Hey there, minimum requirements for our runs state you need **at least** a T12 weapon"
ratchet im sorry i wont be able to join ur runs when u get back ):,Kk ty for letting me know :>
yeah my chat doesnt go that far back anymore so not got any more scs unfortunately :/ thanks for the help,Thank you!<a:jammer:1093575435964653618>
"it was mostly nevermind yeah, think sophie and a couple others joined in trying to do those spell the N word chains where each person puts in a letter but only nevermind was going on and on about it and repeatedly saying it. and yeah reficul's most recent run","Hmm, okay, tyvm. Do you by any chance have or are able to get more screenshots of chat? If not allg, again thank you for reporting it."
"Hi, jsut wanted to report Reficul on how bad he is leading. Were not thinking that i will ever be that angry of some1 leads that i will have to report them. Sadly i dont have proff but i guess i will start recoding from now. He is leading his Void like it would be some kind of vet run, doesnt give calls to stun things,  decoy things, also in void he is  dragging minions without saying the word.  It was not silence run or anything like this seems like bro didnt give f about raiders only about himself.","Thank you for informing us about that. We try to keep our standards high for leading, especially for voids. I will personally notify the HRL team and they will deal with that incident. Thanks again and hope you have only top tier runs from now on. Take care."
Sooo is someone going to unsuspend me,"Hi, I think the bot may have bugged. I'll manually unsuspend you."
jokes are jokes but idk why you're making a joke about molesting someone then talking about working with kids.,"Thank you for bringing this to our attention we will pass this along to the HRL’s so they are aware, if you have a clip feel free to send it to us. Otherwise thank you for your feedback."
hi im blacklisted for some reason and I havent been on this disc in over a year and a half,"Go ahead and DM me *Strasz and I’ll help you out, thanks"
there is not rule that says that i have to kick anyone if his role is security then he should suspend the crushers not me im not going to stop from playing to kick a bunch of crashers and risk dying,"Ignoring staff is a suspendable rule, refusing to kick after request falls under that umbrella."
hi i changed my name wondering where to go to change in h ere,"Hi there, in short this depends on if it was an ingame name change or if you created a new account. Contact any online security and we’ll sort this out for you 🙂"
XBino is just annoying thats all I had to say,"Thank you for the feedback Amanoo. We aren’t sure how much can be done about his general demeanor, but we’ll make sure to let the HRLs know either way!"
"hi i wanted to talk about the rl instagram, i had joined an o3 vc and because today is free runes and everything and some servers are doing open vcs, so i asked him if had called location yet and he got super rude and said maybe if you were in vc you would know but i had just joined it?","Hi, thanks for the feedback. I'll forward this to the HRL team."
hello i did a chain nest about 3 or smth and also afew fungals but i only +1 of each in ;stats,"I’m sorry we’ll look into that for you, thank you for letting us know."
i cant verify my account,"Hey there, please contact *Celoso <@213849524890894336> for assistance as they're the one who's handling your verification."
"the rl notoriousg.a.b got my 8/8 killed today in a lh by not calling out spooky and even said ""sorry i didnt call that out"" which got my nerco killed","Hi, sorry about your character. I will reach out to the HRL team with this information. In future, I would recommend keeping your wits about you when in runs with ""ARL"" or ""TRLs"" as they are learning to lead the dungeons."
i would like to modmail,"Hi, please type whatever you would like to say directly into the bot's DMs and you will get a response."
Why is it 2 days. It's literally a nest,"Hi, our raiding requirements state that you must be 2/8 in attack/dex, and have t12/t4/t12/t4 equipment. Please reach out to <@1030650891533025392> if you have questions about your suspension."
"If that is the case, why were some RL's not allowed to do calls during Oryx Mania runs? Im pretty sure the reason was that it would defeat the purpose of having Osanc.","RLs weren't leading the Oryx event keys because prior to the meeting on Saturday we were not officially allowing any of our staff to lead O3 here. Our stance on that has changed now so our leaders can lead the dungeon if they choose. We don't own OSanc so how they choose to proceed going forward is their decision to make, not ours."
"If Pub Halls can run O3's and Osanc is the sister server, then what is the point of having Osanc? I can understand Vet Runs, since pretty much every server runs O3's in Vets, but in norms?","Hi there, even though we are affiliated servers Pub Halls and Oryx Sanctuary have completely different owners, mods, hrls and so on. The directions both these servers go are completely different and unaffected by each other. O3 wan brought to normal runs as a mean of expanding our dungeons lead and help the growth of out targeted audience. Hope this answers all your questions, if not feel free to keep asking."
Hi is there any way to get unblacklisted?,"Hi, the person who blacklisted you is no longer staff, please reach out to any online Security for help with your verification!"
my discord crashed so was just doing it for the fame. didnt know was expected to leave the run. will remember for the next one,"Hey there, please contact Celoso <@213849524890894336> regarding the warning as they’re the one who issued it."
"i have no problems with people equipping the item because it does give +8 dps stats, but actually using the item is where the troubles come","Hello Jungwoo. I think that is a great idea. While I can’t make any promises on that happening, we will make sure to take it into consideration as it can be a bother quite often when noobs use coin. Thank you for your suggestion."
I feel like I shouldn't have this perm but just pointing it out. I'm not sure if this mutes it on my side only or the whole vc.,"That’s just on your side, you don’t have permission to turn staff down, no worries 😉"
"Yeah that makes sense for really early game dungeons that can get deleted, but i think raid leaders should take more consideration into keeping the afk check open a little bit longer for dungeons that have bosses with high hp pools and multiple invulnerability phases, like any of the epic dungeons, MTs, LoDs, and whatnot. There's plenty of time for everyone to get soulbound damage in, even as a sword player. It's not any RL in particular, just a trend i keep noticing everywhere. Thanks for the quick response!","Of course we’ll pass this along to our HRL’s and maybe they can let the raid leaders know to try and let VC’s fill as much as possible, thank you for your input and feedback we appreciate it !"
Is it really necessary for an RL to keep an AFK check open for only a few seconds if it's a dungeon that won't get filled up completely like a ddocks? I understand this practice if it's an exaltation dungeon during an event. You can easily find a full 45 raiders for those. Really wish RLs could wait a little bit for stuff outside of that.,"Generally we would like for RL’s to allow as many people as they can into a run, but yes sometimes for the exalt dungeons they may not leave it open for as long so they aren’t steam-rolled quite as fast. If there’s a specific issue you’re having with an RL feel free to let us know here, sorry for any inconvenience."

"This modmail is to whichever hrl just did feedback with xbino. I heard that the hrl team was under the impression that xbino asked the raid to send positive modmails, but this was not the case, and he seems genuinely upset that you all think that. Near the end of the cult, he said that after the run he will need to go to feedback because he wasn't allowed to chain. Knowing this was not going to look very good on an new arl, I said in chat ""Everyone send in a positive modmail"", then someone asked ""do modmails even do anything?"". Because of this, I explained how the modmail system works, and xbino said ""yeah modmails actually do something"". That one sentence was the extent of his involvement. The primary reason he got a bunch of positive modmails was because the raiders were genuinely enjoying the runs, myself included, and we didn't want him to get in as much trouble, and also because I encouraged it. I apologize, but please don't hold this against him because he hardly had anything to do with it.","Hey there, thankyou for clarifying this information. Ill be sure to pass the message along to them.

Their leadership skills shine brightly, guiding our group through the treacherous maze of challenges and battles that this dungeon presents. What sets Xbino apart is not just their expertise but also their ability to make the entire experience immensely enjoyable and memorable.",Thanks we appreciate your feedback and it’ll be passed along to our HRL’s.

"Awesome, thank you",Stay chilling
Well that seems vague and unhelpful. Who’s to say when someone is saying a slur “on the safe side”,"I am being vague for the sake of, I don't believe in being overly restrictive when people don't intend to be offensive (not referring to slurs here but just general speech).  But I will def be more on top of moderating offensive language, as it seems you're uncomfortable about it and you're right that I should pay closer attention to when it is dropped, and I will be more conscientious about presenting myself in a professional way as well.  And again, if there are things you are uncomfortable with, you can always DM me a link/post in modmail and one of us will get to it, if I'm not there to."
Cool so what’s the list of acceptable slurs to say in a non-targeted fashion. I wanna be sure I and everyone else is only as bigoted as you allow us to be.,"Err on the safe side and when in doubt, don't say any 🤌"
I was told there was a “0 tolerance policy” for slurs and I’ve seen the r-slur about 10 times in the last 15 minutes alone. Does the mod team actually care or is 0 tolerance just something I was told?,"Hi Banjo it's Sea :) There is a zero tolerance policy to certain slurs of course, but we also recognize that this is an online server and people have a tendency to lean towards... more unsavory language.  I won't claim that I'm not guilty of that myself as well!"

"Reply to previous mod mail: So it appears I'm getting the glitch every time, and with issue of latency it most likely means I won't be able to make any raids then. Well thank you for trying to help anyway, I appreciate it.",We're always happy to answer any questions you might have. I hope the issue fixes itself and that you're able to join runs in the near future.
"Reply to previous mod mail: I've tried again, this time it doesn't show me in the channel but it makes the joined channel noise and I can hear everyone who joins and leaves the call. I wasn't waiting in lounge beforehand either.","Hey there, This is also part of the latency issue with the discord Glitch."

Because of this I am unable to spam the join button so when the channel does unlock I am never able to make it in.","This is a Discord glitch where your client-side thinks that it made it into the VC, but server-side you didn't.

"Kopsees, i havent played for about a year though","You have been removed from blacklist now, feel free to go through the regular verification process."
just wondering why im blacklisted,"Your old verification was denied by a staff member since your account was so new, and so you were added to the blacklist. I will go ahead and remove you from the blacklist so you can go through verification once again. Please give me your current RotMG name."

"Hi, I'd like to leave this modmail regarding the Raid Leader Nelston. I was just in a run where they made a few comments and jokes that I felt were inappropriate, and that made me feel uncomfortable, including joking about the size of their dick and reading clearly sexual or inappropriate comments from other raiders. It made the run extremely awkward for me and I didn't feel it was an acceptable way for an RL to behave. If the server rules allowed for it then I would have deafened halfway through, as a result of their comments.","Hi, thank you for your modmail.  We definitely don't encourage these types of things being spoken about within our raids; we'll forward this along to an HRL to look into.  Thank you for letting us know!"

Hows it going? So i think i got banned like 3 years ago for leaching lost halls.

I would appreciate if youd consider lifting my ban -ZebrahKilr,Please message any online Security and they will help you out :)

"During vet runs, does security also have to meet reqs?

Hey I have a question. Can the old stats which i had from my old discord account be transferred to this one?,"I believe some of your stats can be transferred over, dm an officer to inquire"
ok ill be an exalt leader then :D,We'd love to have you!
"ill consider it, 7 is a lot for me with uni",You are able to be an Exalt Leader (no quota but you need to do *something* and not sit there with the role) which is allowed with exclusivity. You can also be shatters banner which needs 7 points a week. Shatters counts for I think 1.5 points (could be more) so not 7 runs led
"tubs the goat as always, thanks for awesome runs i got my knight fully exalted finally with em, also ty for unmuting me to lead for a second time, id join the staff team if i wasnt blocked bc im staff in dung/hcru <3","I'll make sure tubs sees this!

"I’m sorry it had to come to this but I must once again gum up this wonderful machine of cogs and gears with the resin like stick of my biting written word. I am requesting from one human to another not a cheat of the system, but merely an act of mercy. A stay of execution, if you will. I live in a horrifying post capitalist nightmare where I am threatened with starvation and destitution if I do not continue to convert the limited time I have on this planet into labor for the unending hunger of the system that oppresses all of us. Today is not only my only day off until Monday, but also a wonderful opportunity for the mod team to demonstrate a level of human understanding few are lucky enough to experience. All I ask is this glorious Friday be a day of brief merriment. A day where I am both free from the shackles of capitalism but also free from the sins of my past. May I please be un-suspended a day early and serve my last day of suspension tomorrow. Also my daily quest is voids and I’m jonesing for a gemstone so let’s be chill about it.",Banjoboy you crack me up on the daily.  But no.
i will use my Plague Poison to hit you all at once while hiding behind the wall. you stand no chance against me.,We can choose between two weapons. `;suspend` or `;blacklist`. How do you follow?
i will unleash a wave of 50 Estao's upon you. i will not fight back peacefully.,"I am disappointed to hear you have decided to start a war. Just know you are up against the might of the most talented and largest security team to date. We won't go down without a fight and will arm ourselves appropriately to handle whatever foe or creature you throw at us. We have not 100 HP, but a massive health pool of 10000 HP and will use it to our advantage in the upcoming battle."
"no one supported me like ches. no one believed in me, no one cared for me. with his help i became who i am today. he goes beyond just raid leading the Lost Halls dungeon. in fact, it was a proven fact that before I met ches I had a maximum health points of 85, but with his help, he inspired me to push further in who I am in life, and I gained 15 health points just by meeting him. he is like a saint, no raid leader will ever come close to what he has done for me. please seriously reconsider. he even took my coniditon seriously, i always need to focus on the raiding, and with some asmr playing i can do many many dungeons. he risked his job for me. please, he is not at fault.","I feel touched that you were willing to share this story and explain how you were able to better yourself as a person, both mentally and physically through the support of an individual. Know however, that any saint can fall from grace. The highest highs you achieve are a precursor to the lows to follow. Unfortunately, ches was victim to this and however much joy was shared amongst the people who joined his raids will not make up for the actions he took to incur his termination. Regardless, this assessment can not be imparted by you or me, but only by the upper staff who hold the scales of judgement in their hands and wield it with the utmost responsibility, respect and impartiality. I hope you can find an individual who did as much as he did amongst our current staff team, as I can assure you there are those who demonstrate the same potential of sainthood."
"indeed, i treat my Pub Halls as if it's my home you know. i take it very seriously, and will support my blue named chatters always. if i may ask, when will my favorite Lost Halls Raid Leader, ches, be reinstated?","As much as we appreciate your support, we unfortunately can not disclose the details of ches's termination. Know that decisions must be made for a reason. While not visible to the public, there is validity to the reasons why he no longer graces us with the presence of his leading. Until then, for your mental health, I strongly advise turning to other raid leaders to contemplate a new favourite to support with all your heart. 😔"
thank you for a succesful modmail as always.,"Anytime, my good sir. Pub Halls is always here to support the community in anyway possible. As one of our most frequent chatters, we can't let things go unattended for a venerated individual such as yourself."
"oh yes, it has been long. the road is long and dwindling they say, or something. i love to hear you are doing great, my health is like, if i had 100 health points usually, i am like at 45 right now. the sickness is making me very weak and feeble. i wish my lovely friends a good day today and for many moderations to be done. \","Don't let the long road ahead be the reason to lose hope. There is always light at the end of the tunnel and green pastures once the journey is complete. Even if your health is at a 45, all it takes is 1 HP Potion or a couple points of vitality to bring it back up. Thank you for your well wishes and feel fulfilled knowing moderation and security work will continue like the flow of a river, never ending and relentless."
hi it's been a long time my beautiful friends. how is everyone doing today,"Hi there! We are all doing great. How are you doing on this fine day. It has been far too long since you reached out, so we were all concerned about your safety 🥲."

"wow, I didn't do the shaters super well, I'm afraid to do it normally as I'm going to ruin the one I get...",Feel free to message the Raid Leader who suspended you to appeal. It is also best that you do not join Vet runs if you are new to a dungeon that they are running.
is snakeskin shield not allowed,T10 armor is not allowed in exaltation dungeons. You can read more in <#379504881213374475>.

the symbol for what raid is beeig done,"What you reacted to was a headcount, which only serves as an indicator for the RL of how many raiders and special roles they have for a raid.

I never see any raids happenning between 11 and 13 gmt. I have applied in the past for trl to try fill this void just to get some raids happening. its getting annoying i have tones of keys,"Hello there! Our RLs are welcome to run dungeons whatever time is comfortable for them, as it is just a video game."
I did a shatters run with Utahimeee. Havent done many and I got to a certain phase on third boss that is apparently pvpable. Like I said I dont know what i am doing since I havent made it that far yet. Instead of helping me learn he just started yelling at me and saying he was gonna suspend me for a week. When I tried to explain my self he just got all pissy. RLs should be helping people learn the dungeon not threaten to suspend for a week.,"Hello, we are sorry you had this experience with our Raid Leader. Sadly sometimes dungeons are pvpable and players who are not as knowledge of the dungeon will end up accidentally pvping. As it was a public run accessible by players of all skill levels, you should not be punished for being new and unknowledgeable about the dungeon. We will do our best to make sure this does not happen again. Thank you for the feedback."
Mod mail,"Hey, you've reached modmail!  What can we help you with?"
"this guy doesnt stfu and stop singing, hella annoying. RL : Voodi",Thank you for the feedback on our Raid Leader Voodi. Your feedback will be sent to the HRLs. We hope you have a better experience in future raids with us.
"Hi, I find it a bit strange how on ;stats it says kogs done = 26 but with ;milestone it says kogs done = 32. Just letting you know, dont care too much just saw it and felt like sharing.","I'll let the devs know, thanks for bringing it to our attention!"
"I did not see the general rules. My apologies. Having this knowledge I appreciate the leniency. On a completely different note, how would I go about becoming a TRL. Im interested in leading runs",That's okay! Just make sure to give them a read before removing innocent and defenceless raiders.
"Well, I would like to state that the rule that was quoted for my suspension was a rule pertaining to key poppers wrongfully kicking people, not random raiders. While what i did was indeed rude its not currently disallowed by the letter of the law in the discord. I wanted to stress test the rules and I apologize for that.  I understand if this is not sufficient but would like at the very least for a rule to be added about this if I cant, if not my full punishment  at least part of it, waived (rightfully, IMO) on the grounds that there isnt a rule written that I specifically broke. Just was a little too silly of a guy in the moment. Wont happen again. Also I only kicked a priest so that I didnt hurt our dps <3","If you refer to <#482368517568462868> you can see that impersonating a staff member is punishable up to and including a permanent ban or a mute. By telling the key to kick someone, you are impersonating staff and could have been permanently banned from the discord. If you feel as though that is not indicative of what you did, you can instead refer to <#379504881213374475> and go down the the ""1 Week Suspension"" section and see that Trolling, which is a catch-all term but does describe what you did, is a 1 week suspension. Either way you look at it, you got off lighter on punishment than you should have because the person that suspended you decided to be lenient. Additionally, we are not going to create an exhaustive list of every different situation that could get you punished in our raids. Don't do things that you know you shouldn't do, and you won't get in trouble."
I would like to appeal my ban,"Hello, it is a 4 day suspension, but you are always welcome to appeal. Please explain here in mod-mail why you would should not be suspended."
"I'd like to file in a complain about Wild's Fungal Cavern... they popped key too soon and left out like 10 of us in the bazaar, I wish they would headcount more carefully...

We are sorry you had a poor experience, and we hope your future runs with us go better."
hello can i get unbaned because i was in guild which was blacklisted a while ago,"Hey there, please reach out to any online Security and they will look into removing the suspend on your account."
that account is an account that i lost,"Hey there, feel free to DM any online Security and they can help you get the Realm account moved over."
"Ok mb the Headcount was still up so i wasnt sure if the run was happening after the 20min mark i got confused, then at 40 mins at dm ed u guys, thank for clearing up the confusion","No worries, the headcount is just to gauge interest and an actual run starts with the AFK check. Sometimes RLs will say the headcount is aborted anyway, so that nobody is waiting on them to put up a run."
RL said small break its been 40 mins,"Hey there, it looks like Marshall might have aborted the run and is going to put up another when he gets back."
"Hello, I'm not sure if this is the right place to send this, but I was in a fs void by Ultimaterd, tried the Mystic role in skipping for the first time, then got yelled at for stasising minions in Void. I was using a fighting orb during the battle and only switched to tiered for end phase as called for. Switched classes for the next run and *still* got yelled at. Turned me off trying FS's in general.","Hi, we are sorry to hear of your bad experience in our runs, i’ll be sure to pass on this feedback for ultimate to our hrl team."
"Sadly I brought a Conduct and just used the t10 for piercing slimes and crusades, which I don't see the issue with? I mean i can just make the run even slower if thats in the interest of everyone considering swapping to piercing, underreqs UTs is also permitted per rules.","Hi there, unfortunately you cannot use items below minimum requirements as swapouts. The raiding rules permit you to use certain banned items like Staff of Extreme Prejudice or Snake Eye Ring as swapouts because they provide benefits that only apply to very specific situations. But T10 is not a ""banned item"", it does too little damage to be allowed in any situation."
"I would like to file a complaint for being kicked for ""under-reqs"", although perfectly within the boundaries of the rules","Hi, you were kicked because you brought a T10 weapon.  If you'd like to appeal, please message *Ems for further explanation."
who denied me,"Are you referring to veteran verification?  You have 2 voids completed with our bot, and 0 on your RealmEye graveyard.  If you have over 100 completes, feel free to message any security with proof!"
"Either hes high or drunk right now. Constantly screaming random things, swearing a lot to the point that its getting annoying","Hey, thanks for the feedback on Voodi.  As someone who has been in his runs before and wondered the same thing, Voodi is really just that high energy all the time.  Regardless, we'll forward this along to an HRL to look into his runs further."
yk is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable as a raid leader. During his runs he makes enough calls to help through the dungeon. He also interacts with the chat and keeps the runs engaging and entertaining. He encourages raiders to message him after runs with questions and tries to explain mechanics that might not be obvious (such as with MV where many such as myself need help).,"I'm glad you've been enjoying the yk ™️ runs!! Thanks for the positive feedback, we'll send this along to an HRL."
Hello! I'm looking to change my name in the server since I'm using a new account now? My IGN is Machalite,"Hey!  You can either do `;cn Machalite` in <#347885015964712970> or you can DM me, <@480579426099134476> to change it for you.  Either way, you'll have to unprivate your name history on RealmEye!"
tubs is great rl,Thank you for the feedback on our RL. We hope you continue to have good runs with them :)
"thank you so much, sorry for the issue",It should be done :>
"yes, after I sent the modmail I tried to hit the reconnect button but it was well after the bot said it would move me in, and well after the run started","Okay, I will try to get the points refunded :>"
"Hey, I used tickets on Helix's TRL Void run and did not get moved in. Afterward, the channel closed and I lost my tickets. Could I have a refund please?",The bot is saying you were infact moved into his vc but then left one minute later.
"Hi, I think i'm supposed to dm the bot, I came back to the game few weeks ago after a year of not playing and my acc appears to be blacklisted and I don't know why, what could I do?",This is so sad :(
BUT THERE NEVER STANDS ITS REQS 8/8 ITS BULLSHIT,"For non-exalt runs you do not have to be 8/8, just maxed dexterity and attack, which you were not."
but the ^problem there was nothing saying it was an 8/8 reqs thats why your discord is so bad,"Hey there! So if you look and read the image we sent you, it clearly states ""You must be **both** 8/8 and follow the requirements sheet."" As you did not meet these listed requirements ~~forgetting the fact you were 1/8 and not meeting our *normal* requirements~~, you were punished"
"Hi I recently changed my ign, What can I do about it?",If you changed you in-game name (IGN) you can go to <#347885015964712970> and use the ``;cn name`` command. This will automatically change your name for you.
"Utahimeee pog trl, felt like an old school void. super fun run",Great to hear! I’ll pass it on.

yes,"Thank you for bringing this to our attention. You are speaking to a HRL, and I have handled the situation."
I missed a moonlight raid because odds the RL started calling the server in gibbersh as a joke and then popped early. He then mocked the people who called him out for it.  I'm really frustrated because I've been trying to get a first complete of this dungeon for days and nobody ever runs it so I try to join every raid I can.,"Hey there, I'm sorry you had a frustrating run and thank you for sending in a modmail.  Just to clarify before I forward this to an HRL to look into, is this about the EL ""odds""?"

How do i contact hin,You can message them directly by clicking on the name that ViBot sent you in DMs!
"hey, feedback for ElevationP, he started talking about how abortion is messed up in the run, and compared it to killing blind people which is a) an immature and offensive comparison, and b) honestly annoying to hear someone talk about abortion like that, esp when you can't talk back mid-run","Hi, we are sorry you had a bad experience in Elevation’s run, ill be sure to pass on this feedback to the hrl team."
Is that not allowed?,"Hey there, I unmuted you. Your message had a lot of repetitive terms like ""for"" and ""glife"", I recommend making it more concise in the future to avoid getting automatically muted in the future, e.g. ""T6 mace/trap (3 GL)"""

does engraved aspirant count for any points for exalted runs?,"Hey there, please refer to the sheets posted along with the Headcount’s and afk checks, but to answer your question the answer is No they do not count towards any points given."
I got kicked by CF from normal void reacted as vial. 8/8 t13/t3/t14/t5. Theres no reqs for normal void and i was vial so whats the problem? I would love to know if the shield is why i got kicked,Redactables must still meet our basic requirements of 2/8 att/dex and T 12/4/12/4. You were warned both in game and through the bot to not joins runs until you could meet our reqs and still decided to come of your own free. Hence why you have been kicked from the runs and suspended.
"-I believe it is an oversight, so it might be patched (not sure, but i want to share the info anyways)","Thanks for all the info, we will have a look into it."

"Please dont ban realm clearing. I had the best time of my Realm experience with Nelston and the others. Its horrible. If Oryx Sanctuary would put up runs it would be fine but the server is pretty ded. Please just let us have fun. You have really qualified and smart Raid Leaders. Let them live out their Potential to the fullest, in helping others. Especially Noobs are struggling to meet reqs if they never did an o3. Imagine grinding for a  whole week just to meet reqs and then die in the o3 because its ur first one and u couldnt learn it properly. Just dont ban it","Sorry, we will not be allowing our Raid Leaders to lead O3s in this Discord. Our quality of raid leading is important to us, and Realm Clear O3s would not only be new to a lot of RLs, it would also be mostly un-monitored; not to mention our staff team is not experienced in giving feedback on O3s. Furthermore, we encourage our Raid Leaders to also lead in Oryx Sanctuary if they wish."
I reacted as the ogmur tho,"Hey there, regardless as if you reacted to a priority react you are expected to be in VC for the entire run. "
Kanoin didnt say sorry for your loss when i died 😠 very important part of being an RL,Omg I can't believe he didn't do that!!! I will crucify him immediately!
"Hello, just came back into the game and decided to try to exalt my classes, I don't know why I was blacklisted",You were denied verification by an ex staff member feel free to contart any online security and they will be more than happy to help you out :)
I had a run with the rl Instagram. Everything went smooth in a fame cult until the vc crashed. It got stuffed and about 7 people died. I just wanted to set things clear. It wasnt his fault and he tried his best to save us. Just know that he tried and if he gets  negative modmails its a server problem and not his. I like him. Just make sure the vcs dont crash xD,"Alright, we'll keep this in mind thank you :)"
How do I get rusher role,If you rush 3 flames and 3 hideouts consecutively without fail then you can ask the rl for a commend :) Keep in mind they must be rl+ to use the command iirc.

"hello! I didn’t know it was lost halls disc so I didn’t know there were rules and kanoin understood that after I asked them about the suspension. Some random person in the same nexus as me typed out to go to right bazaar, I didn’t have a reason to remember their name","Hey there, please keep in mind its not a great idea to go into a dungeon run in a Bazaar if you are not in a VC for that run being set up as you may be punished by any discord server that Utilize Bazaar's for Raids and it may put you at risk of breaking rules for a Losthalls Raid such as ""Crashing""."
"I tried contacting Kanoin but they ignored me. The response to my modmail made it seem like maybe I wasn't clear. I wasn't asking for a warning in place of the suspension, i was asking for a warning inside the dungeon that I ""crashed"" since I was unaware it was private. I was in nexus and I was told to go to the right baz for lost halls so I went there and then I get kicked and suspended despite my gear being better than other raiders' gear.","Hey there. Again, you must follow our rules outlined in <#379504881213374475> in order to properly participate in our runs. Who told you to go to right bazaar?"
Hi can I talk to a moderator,"Hey there, feel free to DM any online Security and they will help you sort out your verification."
Kanoin is lame for suspending without warning from a run that i had reqs,"Meeting requirements does not excuse crashing, you still need to follow the raiding rules and be veteran verified if you want to participate in vet runs. Whether you receive a warn or a suspension is at the RL's discretion and can be stricter for vet runs. If you wish to appeal, please contact `Kanoin (vqle.)`"

Blib is actually very funny and i enjoy doing the runs with him.

He didn't make a lot of calls, was def. irritated or depressed about something and clearly not in the frame of mind to lead a fullskip void and didn't call medium, bigbois or shotguns or most of MBC phases...thankfully I know these things by heart now but if I were a new player id be VERY confused at what's going on and if that was the only experience I had with this discord probably never use it again",Thank you for sharing.

Im Scheider i have a new Discord account,"Hi Scheider, feel free to dm any online security and they will help you verify your new discord account"
"I used ticket in LyonBastia's void run 22:41, but he resetted it, due to no vc, do i get a refund for this?","Hey there, the run was aborted and you should see the points automatically refunded if you use ;stats in `#bot-commands`"
"I lost my previous discord account that i used to get verified in this server, can i be verified under this discord account please","If you DM one of the online Securities, they will be more than happy to help you get verified on this Discord account :)"
"It says, ""You are currently blacklisted from the Lost Halls server and cannot verify. The person who blacklisted you is no longer staff. Please DM me and send mod-mail to that server to appeal."" Is it alright if I join?",Yah feel free to contact one of our online securities :)
https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/ceremonial-merlot why is this not 1/4?,"1/4 is at the discretion of the VRL so you can ask them before the run. On some sheets, the only damage tome considered 1/4 is Chaotic Scripture due to its Area of Effect damage for clearing"
thats something on your end no? I joined call and it was already popped,Looks like you joined the vc 3 minutes after he closed it. I assumed you meant you joined the vc and just missed the run lol. I'll to get them refunded.
it was alreeady popped lol,I don't think we'll refund you for that.
I used tickets but I didnt get in the run can I get refund,"We only refund tickets if someone misses a run because of something on our end. It looks like the bot dragged you in as it should, why were you not able to make it to the run?"
"mystaldi had a lot of good tips for my first kog run, hope I get him again for another run",That’s great to hear. I’ll pass it on.
"I'm having an issue verifying my account. I just came back to the game after a long hiatus and i was verified in this server previously, but when i came back i couldn't see any of the VCs. I need help please.",The account you attempted to verify as is already verified within the server on a different discord account. Reach out to any online security and they will be able to help you switch it over for you.
"I was issued a warning for being ""Under-geared"" but I don't recall being under geared with any of my previous runs. Is colo, oreo, overalls, ubhp under-geared?","Sorry for the mistake. You were not supposed to be warned for being under-geared, but instead for crashing one of our runs. We will remove the warning and replace it with one for crashing."
I quickly swapped to my normal wand soon after the beginning of the run,Unfortuantely that was not noticed during the run. We ask that you never equip gear that is below the minimum requirements.
How am I undergeared?,"You were wearing a t11 wand, which does not meet reqs in regular runs. You can read more about the rules in <#379504881213374475> (raiding rules)."
veteran role thing,Do you mean you accidently attempted veteran verification or that you have the 100 void completes?
i made oopsie,"Hello, this is modmail. What oopsie did you make?"
coolfood said usw4 bottom nexus ddocks then said resetting after in nexus and started popping random keys i pointed this out and he deleted the chat in raid status,He said he was going to only do one ddocks iirc so I thikn he probably just decided to pop random keys after that
"Zerh is the best rl i ever met. Hes funny,smart and gives really good calls. I actually enjoyed a fame cult chain bcs of him xD He is a really great rl","Glad you had a good run!  Thanks for the feedback, we'll forward this to the HRLs :)"
Zerh is the chillest rl and i will run dungeons with him anytime that he is leading,"Glad you had a good run!  Thanks for the feedback, we'll forward this to the HRLs :)"
"I cannot verify any accounts because I am blacklisted from oryx sanctuary by a staff that is not staff anymore. I applied one time by accident, just understanding the process. I need to appeal so I can get verified for lost halls which I am qualified for","Hey there, you'll have to get the expel removed by the security in Oryx's Sanctuary. We let them know you were blacklisted by former staff and they are looking into it, but you can get in contact with an Osanc security member for updates."
I would like to verify for lost halls,Have you tried heading over to <#471711348095713281>?
Ok thank you have a splendid day dear security/officer/admin,"Thanks fam bam, hope you have a good one too :)"
thank you for your kind advice and words i really appreciate them gang. however i would just like to state it was a full skip and i can ensure you that me (the goat) did not peak a cru or anything wrong and I also look at my map to view where the keys are coming in from in order to do the most pumpington that I can towards the keys. is there any way I could appeal this punishment and reform so I can get back at the lost halls raiding and listen to the beautiful raid leading that occurs there?,"If you'd like to appeal, please directly message the person who suspended you :)"
!modmail KEEP IN MIND THERE IS 0 RULE AGAINST DEAFENING IN LOST HALLS SERVER,"• Crashing (Not being in voice chat while in run): If you want to participate in a run, you must be in voice chat. This same rule applies to deafening yourself."
!modmail,"Hi, you have reached modmail!  What can we do for you?"
hows my verification going?,"Hi!  To start the verification process, please react to the checkmark in <#471711348095713281> ."
"hello Admins Im very confused since ive been blacklisted, for no apperant reason. Im using a new account since last one was lost. Need help whant to do discord mbc not pub 🙂","It appears you were blacklisted in our sister server, Oryx Sanctuary. Please reach out to <@!704447243285168239> via discord dms to get it rectified and then we can verify you here."
"Yeah I know, I'm saying can I still rush during the run without reacting?","That is the RL's discretion and many RLs would be open to you trying to rush as long as you ask them ahead of time. However, you'll still need to meet reqs - *T0 decoy is fine when rushing"
Ok! thanks. And am I allowed to rush without reacting for rusher just to practice 😄,You need the rusher role to react to it.
"Hi, what's the policy on getting the official rusher role? Am I allowed to come to runs to practice rushing? And if so can I bring a 0/8 trix?",If you're doing runs in <#379779029479194624> then you must be meeting the reqs in <#379504881213374475> however if you're doing them in <#556931967497666570> you may ask the RL and if they let you then you can. You get the role by rushing all pot rooms and hideout in a cult run. Just ask the RL of the run that you are going for the role and if they deem you worthy then they shall bestow the role upon you.
i got into the VC late and the rl already called pop when i got there,"Sure, we can refund those points.  In the future, please make sure to be a little more pro-active when you're joining the run as they can start very quickly!"
I previously joined the LH pub server a few years ago and am a returning veteran. My username is Junsang - check my realmeye,"Hi!  The account `Junsang` is already verified in the server, so please message an online security to verify ownership of your account and get verified :) "
hey,"Hey there, you're all set!"
i missed the dungeon with timefame for cult and i used my supporter points,"Hi, what exactly happened that made you miss the run?  Was it a matter of not making the dungeon, or were you unable to get into VC in time for the call?"
error,"Hello, youve reached the mod-mail team. Can we assist you?"
"Cheggles hosted void, was missing most timings by 2-3 seconds.

I'll let the HRL team know!"
"oh i dont give a fuck about discords, just i got a random warning when i didnt know. i dont really give a shit about being kicked from a kuckbold either lol","If you don't care about raiding servers then a suspension doesn't really matter.  It's a way for us to prevent people who consistently crash within our server from continuing to crash; as our raiding spots should be taken by people who *aren't* crashing.  That's why suspensions exist--especially right now when an event is going on and VCs fill up really fast, we want more of our raiders to make it into our runs."
i was in the bazaar before you guys,"It's still not advised to enter keys popped in bazaars, or be open to the possibility of being kicked if you do (since bazaars are used for the ability to kick players). If you wish to appeal, please contact `Hueghjass`"
"How? didnt even know it was a discord, go fuck yourself","Hey there, I understand it can be frustrating to get kicked or suspended when you don't know it's a Discord run. To prevent this in the future, try not to follow large groups of players entering bazaars."
"Subwayfres didnt move me into the call after i used tickets to get in early, he then outright ignored me when i asked to be moved into the call or to get my tickets back","Hey there, sorry to hear that you missed the run we'll get your ticketed returned to you shortly. "
I am looking to get unblack listed as im back into rotmg and i got black listed for 0 reason,"That's strange :( If you contact any online security they will be more than happy to assist you! If you want you can dm me ""Blib"""
RL odds took me through my very first moonlight I made it all the way through his calls were calm quick and clear very epic,We are so happy to hear this! Let's hope they host some more soon :) And thank you for the feedback.
"If I spend tickets and the bot did not drag me fast and cause that I no hear the loc, u can refund me the tickets?","Sorry that happened. In this case, we will refund you the lost tickets. They should be available momentarily."
can i have my 20 tickets back? i double loaded into the bazaar and missed :|,"Hey, I’m sorry but we only refund tickets in certain situations like the bot messing up or something along those lines."
"Hello pubhalls, i am here to report an abusive chatter by the name of Andrewaa. Throughout the whole kogbold chain this person was constantly haraassing other raiders, but to me it became too much when he started being racist to the RL, Nicode, spamming an offensive name. I attached photo proof to this message but I forget if you can see them in the modmail channel, I can dm them if you ask. Nicode is a chill person and simply just muted him but I feel that it should be dealt with so that this person does not harass other people/rls like this in future runs, especially when it is of a racist nature. Thank you for reading","Hey there, thanks for bringing this to our attention aswell as attaching photo evidence we will look into the situation further and handle accordingly. Thanks again and have a great day! <:frogheart:874349470316371988>"

"this is intended for LH server mods Hi! Regarding the reqs needed for exalted runs, I was wondering if something could be added regarding the new enchanting and aspirant gear. From what I've tested (just with dagger classes so far), the base knife (aspirant dagger) outdamages t13, and enchanted (with swiftblade atleast) is on par with t14. The full stat bonuses from any of the 4 path rings make it on par with if not better than stat rings like lodestone and esben, atleast for the paths of swiftblade/sniper/and stalwart. And the armor, when enchanted, gains extra stat points that would make it, at minimum, above t12 (ex. the aspirant hide enchanted with swiftblade is basically a direct upgrade from the golem hide, which is worth 1 point). If this all stands, would it be possible to count a 3/3 enchanted aspirant set as being worth atleast 2 points for meeting advanced reqs? Thx","Hey there, I'll forward your suggestion to the people who make the Req sheets but I can't confirm that they will be added to our sheet. "

oh nice! thanks :D,"Of course! Happy to answer questions, don't hesitate to ask more in the future"

is it considered crawshing if i used tickets to get loc but forgot to join vc,It is expected and required for everybody to be in vc for the run. We define crashing as being  in the run/location without being in vc. Make sure you join lounge before reacting with tickets to ensure that you do not get removed
kicked?,"Hello, if you were wrongly kicked, please contact the Security or the Raid Leader from the run."
"Having the Advanced Steamworks raids also ping the normal Steamworks role is very annoying. If I wanted to go to Advanced Steamworks, I’d get that role",We will consider changing it! Thanks for the suggestion!
Both Instagram and Sparrowist were harassing the key for asking to do t room in nests along with the other raiders. They did not ask them to stop but instead promoted it and I don't think the key popper liked it a lot  and probably wont be popping more keys for the discord anymore. Didnt think that rls should promote the toxicity that the raiders were giving the key popper,"Hmm, okay this is very not okay. Do you by any chance have a better screenshot of the chat as the one you provided lacks context apart from you've claimed. I'll talk to the keypoppper directly as well if I can, thank you for reporting this I will forward it to the HRL's and we will make sure it doesn't happen again. Very much the opposite of the behaviour we want from our staff team. Have a nice day!"
having a problem seeing my stats 🙂,I don't see any messages of you going to <#347885015964712970> and typing `;stats`?

oryxpumper is the definetion of why ppl hate discords from time to time rules for some not for him and in his own runs he is a control freak 2 attack under reqs and u done mate otherwise/at the same time reqsheet needs updates cuz it cant be right water robe is reqs when a robe that gives more att dex wis and mana not is,"Sorry you had this encounter, I'll let the HRL team know"
Which security should i sent it to? I dont wanna spam afk security people,You can send it to me <@327078279586512907>
iSo if i had 50 mbc completions and 100 void completions then i would be verified as a veteran?,If you can send proof of 100 voids to a security then yes that's absolutely fine
remnant voids dont count as void completions right?,"In terms of ""completes"" for vet role, having 100 mana exaltations is considered proof of 100 void completes. In terms of ""completes"" on the bot when you do `;stats`, it will not show up because they were not run as a separate AFK check"
Do stats no longer work? I have tried for days,Try typing `;stats` in <#347885015964712970> it should work
Lordrealm during his ddocks runs said 30 seconds between runs to drop in vault. after maybe 10 seconds he said 10 seconds to pop then counted to 7. and popped not leaving enough time to get in based on what he said. Sounds petty and it probably is but its annoying to miss the late night runs when there aren't as many going on.,Sorry to hear that this was your experience during our runs. We will do our best to make sure future runs don't go the same way. Thank you for your feedback.
Is that a yes or a no?,"Fine, I’ll tell you, yes, but it’s a secret shhhhh 🤫"
I'm confused. Is MBC actually Pubhalldad,Maybe 😛
"was kicked from roarkey's raid for no reason, had reqs and vial","Sorry to hear that. We will look into it. If you receive a warning or suspension, feel free to message mod-mail again."
I understand that you cannot accommodate all lost tickets but I just lost about 60 to infinite loads today 😦,Hey there. You can reach out to an online security with the proof of this and we will consider it.
Nelston underrated rl he deserves the rl role. Positive feedback from me,Yah we agree he's great !
I just got worned for being under reqs when I had the reqs,"Looks like you had an A.S.S which is a banned item, you are allowed to use banned items at the moment as long as you have an item in your inventory that enables you to meet the requirements but staff are also allowed to punish you without checking for this item. It's a bit messed up at the moment but we're working to fix it. For now if you still wish to appeal you will have to contact the staff member which warned you; <@451885229343375360>."
Just wanted to give feedback for ElevationP he's great at leading and explained everything in moonlight clearly so I could actually finish one for the first time 😄,"Glad to hear that :) I will forward this to the hrl's! Feel free to in the future send any other feedback you have for our staff team, we take our raider's opinion very seriously."
I cant hear the raid leaders and I dont know why. Have I been suspended? It would be weird when I have noit played in this server for a long time.,This is probably the issue you are having: https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/378991029186985985/868897576051699742
Got it. Is there also an ETA on when the advanced sheet in RSA will be updated?,There is always a lot being worked on. It will be released when it gets released.
Why do most people consider T15 robe to be 1/4 but not wsilk? I can understand if it is on a sorc or something but classes like wizard and bard don't really need the extra mp and wis,"Hello, this is probably something you want to take up with the RLs who make their own req. sheets and not mod-mail. Remember req. sheets are not perfect and not all items will be included on them."
"Hi, my main account got banned and this is my new account that I started up","Hi, please feel free to reach out to any online Security for help with your account transferal."
"Yes, I know it normally does that. But the issue here is I sent him proof that I used my tickets in dms.","Yup--we've discussed it with him on our end already, and your points have been refunded!"
"Hello, I would like to modmail Subwayfres, as I used the tickets to get into the run and the bot would not drag me. I had location, I dmed him my situation and he chose to ignore me. therfore getting me kicked and wasting my ticket points.","Hi, thanks for letting us know!  Given how normally the bot will allow you to join VC when you spend points, I think it's possible that Subwayfres assumed that you were a raider that was trying to get early VC without the use of points (which happens).  "
"I'd like to commend Nelston, such a great RL. Makes all the calls and does perfect job for the group!","Thanks for your feedback, it's much appreciated. We hope your future runs with them continue to be a good experience :)"
"plz promote unknownkal to rl, most fun run in a hot minute","Thank you for the positive feedback, we will pass it on to the HRLs. If there is anything else you’d like to share about this RL, please do."
"'GPU | CPU has been spamming afks whenever he wants even when all the other rls are waiting for their turn to put up an afk. He does not seem to care or have any patience, which causes all other rls to wait longer","Yop, that is something we aim to avoid but some people forget to check rsa. I will forward this to the hrl team and if it continues to be a problem he will be spoken to about it to avoid this in the future. Thank you for the feedback and feel free to send us anymore feedback you have for other rl's in the future!"
Hi when I try to verify I get a message saying the account is already verified with a member.  I think I was in the channel before and left?,DM any online Security for assistance with verification.
"ErikErik Very cool leader, I love the energy and positive vibes!","Thank you for the positive modmail!  Glad you're enjoying, we'll forward this along as well :)"
"hey, can i get a feedback on why am i blacklisted?",You were blacklisted because you were denied verification ~2 years ago. Please message any online Security and they should help you get verified :)
DM who? sorry i just dont know,Please DM <@135866532138844160> `mrkeegan` and I will assist you.
Online security?,Any of the online securities. They are the ones with the blue names :)\
So I verified probably a few years back now under a different discord account. However since then I've made a new one and I have forgotten the old one. Is there a way that I can verify using this account?,DM any online security and they will help sort this out
"so, about lorox's void...we hit pots, which is understandable and I don't really mind, but during MBC survival, we got a good rotation and he said don't push in, wait for another key (which was still miles away)...we then had to wait for another two rotations to finally kill the last key and he said we have bad DPS (which was also kinda true, but we could get that key much earlier if he didn't do that ""don't push in"" call) - we ended up with 32 people after MBC (from 50 of course)",Thank you for your input. We will pass this along to our HRL team for feedback.
Hello,Hello \:)
How do I do that?,DM one of these lovely people
Apply to get unsuspended from Lost Halls discord,"Hello, please message an online Security to appeal your suspension."

can i get unsuspended i left the blacklisted guild a long time ago,"Hey man you are now unsuspended! Thank you for bringing this up to modmail, and if you need and further help regarding this you’re welcome to DM me `wussboppin`"
What happened to the previous lost halls classroom discord,The same server has existed since 2019; unless you mean something prior to that? 
"Tubs #1 rl, always love to join his high energy fun raids :)","We are so sorry you had this interaction with one of our raid leaders. We will be sure to pass this on to our HRL team for feedback. Rest assured, justice will prevail."
can i get unsuspended?,"Hello, please contact any online Security to get further help with your suspension"
"Terry, Lost halls RL for fungal is trash. no callouts almost missed mother kuz he told everyone to go the wrong ways. It doesnt appear he knows any rotations for fungal or phases. is counting things in spanish also lol",We appreciate the feedback you've given and it will be looked into. We hope your future runs will give you a better experience.
"Terry is missing all fractal callouts, messed up a pretty easy map layout, failed to call stasis, etc. While leading an Exalted Fungal Cavern.","Thank you for your feedback, it will be looked into. We hope you have a better experience in future runs."
"also.. he was verified in osanc manually, and then canceled it because of lh security.","We have certain requirements for people we verify, and it was deemed that your friend did not meet these requirements. That is why they were instructed as they were. If you feel that their verification was not correctly handled by the Security, please have your friend message an Officer about it."
"The reasoning is, his acc is old ( as most accounts are ) and that he just started playing recently? Wtf kind of a response is that? Security didn't even ask him for screenshot just denied him verification and now he cant join osanc or LH.",There is usually a good reason for us denying players. Can you please tell us the realm name of your friend?
NINJAUNICORN did'nt put the location for earlies and forgot to pop the key after 50 and i did'nt make it and i was a early cuz crashers,"Sorry about that, ill have someone give your points back."
i need to manual verify. other discord bannedhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1132877159137038356/1132877171283730502/image.png,DM any online security for help swapping it over.
"I would like to suggest that we allow VRL and/or RL to request keys in <#943879720066498580>. That way, we can reduce double pings in vsa/rsa when we are requesting keys for vets. Often times, we would ping in rsa for keys, but i think the multiple pings could be helped if we just pinged once in <#943879720066498580>.",Hey Fatty 👋 This is Benjamin.
Kicked from a run with T11 wand but T6 scepter and Diplo robe tell the security to use some critical thinking about gear before kicking,"Hey, regardless of your other equips, the gear reqs we outline in our rules are the *minimum* baseline of what to bring.  However, you were not suspended, merely kicked for not bringing the proper equipment so it's no real harm no foul as long as you bring proper gear in the future."
"Okay here is name history screenshot, for some reason my previous IGN is not showing here, maybe due to RealmEye's API being messed up? either way I just need to have correct IGN so I can not be kicked in runs please","Hi, I'm sorry for the confusion and please let me clarify.  We require the Realmeye name history to be unprivated and verified through the bot/security changing your name; this prevents spoofing and verifies that the account did indeed change their IGN."
I would prefer not to unprivate name history so I was wondering if you could do it for me,"Hi!  Regardless of the proof, we need you to unprivate your name history (whether going through a bot or through a security) to verify that the original account is indeed changed, as this type of evidence can be spoofed quite easily.  I know it's annoying, but you're allowed to private your name history as soon as your name is changed."
Requesting a name change to Cartier,Go to `#bot-commands` channel and type ;cn newnamehere
"Dude number one, i got kicked from the vc  number 2, I used my points number 3 refund my points.",Hey there. Please reach out to <@263104153377570827> `@arnz.` in discord DMs if you wish to appeal this. Thank you!
please unban me from the public lost halls discord. its been two weeks since i left the blacklisted guild PPE menaces. IGN JumpSneak,"Hey there, you are unsuspended. As long as you don't join back you will be good to go. Have a great day!"
"hello, i was denied from verifying in the lost halls discord by blib. he told me i needed a bit more playtime to verify i was not on an alt discord account? i guess. i was wondering if i could get verified now, it has been about a week since he and i talked and i messaged him the other day to no response.","Hey there! Thank you for reaching out. We will let blib know to check his DMs. If you feel the need to, you may contact another online security to assist you. Sorry for any delays, we all have real life responsibilities and sometimes it takes a bit to respond. Have a great day! 🙂"
"ouh yea i heard a funny idea from rl/raider that a security died in lh cause of drags when parsing they said the serv shd make security gaurds XD, anyways thanks for answering my queries","We've all died many times whilst parsing sadly, I wish there was a way to void it lol. And good luck on your apps, might see you on the staff team soon!"
"soo outta curiosity for the guy answering my questions, how can i increase my chances of el/security applications, or how do you choose el/security","We base it mostly of the applications, if you wrote a good one you will have a good shot at it and if not then maybe next time! It also depends on how many people we are ""hiring"", sometimes there's more applications than we need so even someone with a good one may still be denied."
## through embeds naturally :> 💀,"Thank you for the feedback, I will forward this to the HRL's have a nice day !"
around how many people applies for el/security when applications are open?,"Normally it's at most in the low hundreds, around 50-200 ish and then rarely 201-400."
sup was wondering how would i know if i get accepted as el,One of our staff members will contact you via dms most likely no later than a week after the apps close.
"Trl run by lorox on void was just awful. Dude sounded like he did not want to be there at all, no oratory whatsoever. Terrible map reading, most raiders even tried to go into the right direction lots of the time because most knew how to map read, but he kept saying wrong directions even though. Void calls were outright mediocre",Hey there. We appreciate the feedback but please remember that TRL runs are done by those with little to no experience leading and these runs are done to help them learn.
"Likely blacklisted because I used to be verified a while ago, and went inactive for months.","Hey there, you are no longer blacklisted. Feel free to verify through the bot now."
"Hello! This isn't too important, but I used tickets (and they were accepted) for a void run and was not able to get in at all, despite there being spots left open. Is there any way for my tickets to be refunded, or do I just lose them?","Hi there! We sincerely apologize but our policy is to only refund points if the run gets aborted or there is a serious issue that occurs where the run does not occur. Unfortunately, since you just got unlucky with the timing, we won't be able to refund your points for this run."
"I am unable to complete the verification portion that requires the graveyard. My graveyard is public but because of the realmeye api, the bot won't recognize my graveyard as updated, therefore I can't complete verification","That is okay, don't worry. Please contact any security and we'll sort this out together manually whenever you're ready to do so. This is a common glitch with Realmeye graveyards."
I was told I could try verifying after I waited a week to make sure my account wasnt an alt,"Hey there, reach out to any online security for help with that."
Can people join runs without reacting in the headcount? Because I see 44 reactions but 47 people in the vc,"Yes, other Raid Leaders/staff can join VC after it closes."
sparrowist didnt wait once again until everyone from vc was in the locaiton and told key to pop anyway,"Hey there, sorry to hear this. I'll forward your feedback to the HRLs. If you're having trouble loading into the bazaar for future runs, try sending the RL a Discord DM. That way, they'll know to wait for you."
usw3?,hello! could you elaborate please? what is this in reference to?
He kicked me from VC,"I don't think he kicked you from his vc, you may have disconnected though? If this happens again in the future make sure to head over to <#379779029479194624> and click the reconnect button :)"
SubwayFres rude conduct in run,What exactly did he say?
"Hey i would like to report an rl named OryxPumper. He hosted some vet nests that required a 2/4 set, i joined in with a 2/4 set and he parsed me and when i told him why he just said oh well you cant use a swap out thats not req and i told him it was just a swapout item and that i am still 2/4 and he just said sorry to shrug it off and proceeded to chain the keys and didnt think much of me. I wasted a good 15minutes waiting for him to finish his keys so he could soft reset and call for a new location. He couldve soft resetted after he kicked my by accident and apologize but he just didnt choose to do that welp",Thanks for letting us know. We’ll mention something to him about his behavior. Cheers
"Hey 🙂 I got a new discord account, but my old one is still connected to my current Rotmgacc. Can i transfer the verification to this account?",Sure man. Please message any online Security for assistance with switching your account over.
I would like to request to change my name. It is on a different account so i cannot use the bot commands.,DM an online security for assistance with that.
"the advice he gives regarding the phase that is occuring is perfect, how to combat the phase how to position yourself, what you can tank and what u cant, and hes very specific regarding the way he gives his instructions making completion alot easier. i learnt alot in one run just by listening to his calls","That is very nice, I'll let them know now, again ty for the feedback we appreciate it and if you have any feedback for other rl's in the future feel free to let us know!"
"Odds is a really good rl, he does amazing jobs at moonlight",I'm glad to hear :) Is there anything specific you like about his leading style or is he just good at what he does? If no response I will forward this to the HRL's thank you for the feedback and have a nice day !
"I got warned for dragging shades? when i was going mid to help kill it, i almost accidently dragged it and he said something, so on the 2nd one, i crossed platforms to EP it",Contact <@244208105699803140> if you wish to appeal :)
"Hey there, it's already been 2 weeks since I got suspended. Could I get unbanned?","Yep, we'll get you unsuspended as soon as possible :)"
"Got blacklisted long ago, but I don't know why. Can I be verified and unblacklisted?","Hey, feel free to contact me in dms :) Blib or Blib1"
"My account isnt an alt, its my steam account with 100 hours i just so happend to come back some days ago and i just discovered the discord too but you can see ive lost so many characters on my graveyard since like a year ago. I didnt want to insist too much but i go back to uni in two weeks and probably wont play anymore by then","Unfortunately due to your low play-time, we'd like you to continue playing for at least a 1 week (reduced). We are sorry if that does not line up well with your real life responsibilities."
"who do I dm it just says a bunch of numbers: "" or want to otherwise appeal, please message <@691930841198231602>, or <@371489458027233280> (<@691930841198231602> or <@371489458027233280>).""",Apologies for that. Discord @'s can be quite tricky sometimes. Those two are @'s of Security blib (@ blib1) and Emisaurus (@ emilycross)
Hello I had a question regarding banned gear. I see that dalvers battle axe is banned but what about battle axe and gillahorn combo. According to the wiki this combo gives higher dps than sword of colossus. I am using it on pali btw.,"The reason the DPS increases so much is due to the set giving berserk. For solo play, this is great, but you'll usually always be buffed in our raids by warriors."
The ;stats command returns an error whenever I use it and has been for a while. Other people can use it just fine. IDK who to tag or DM so Im sending a modmail about the issue,"Yeah, thank you for reporting it. We're already aware and are currently working to fix it! Sorry fore the inconvenience."
ive lost my last discord account and wish to verify this one,DM any online security and they will be able to assist you.
I am verificated but I can't see raids,Hey there. Please reach out to <@135866532138844160> `mrkeegan` or any other online security and we would be happy to assist you.
I asked for drag,"I can see that you're in gpu's vc, are you supposed to be somewhere else?"
"Rulerzeus is only a moderator tho. Do you, by any chance, know the best way to bribe one of the admins (preferrably chevyo or downdraft)","Alright no more spamming mod-mail. If you're that desperate to chat with staff, bring it somewhere else."
Well thats not very cash money of the higher ups. How many signatures would i need to bring those three channels back,"Feel free to start a Petition, but can't guarantee it's gonna bring changes since the big shot said No."
why not :(,The big shot said no. There is likely no need and not enough interest to warrant bringing it back at this time.
"Why was my application denied? i have a 8/8 full set i dont think im missing anything to at least be verified, if the set is the problem i have full t12, 5, 13 and t4 in inventory. Did i miss something?",We believe the RotMG account you are trying to verify under may be an alt account - play actively for two weeks and then reach out to <@371489458027233280> (emilycross) to appeal the verification.
"Now that we have event boi back, when are we getting event-chat, raider casual chat, and event casual chat back?",No
"hello, I'd like to remove the name Abyss from verification with this discord please, thank you","Hello, it does not seem like you are verified with the RotMG name ""abyss"" in this Discord (Lost Halls)."
"Good afternoon, as you can see i already have a DS account by the name of الشاب تقي الصغير (TAKIEDDINE). That DS got locked so as i lost all the ds servers in it including this one, this is my new one. I got all proofs that it belongs to me even my rotmg account",You can message any online Security and we will get your verification transferred for you :)
"Ty. Sorry for misunderstanding. Been a few years since ive played ROTMG, forgot how clean some of these discord integrations are 🙂","No worries mate, happy raiding"
"Just getting the ""Youre under manual review message"" But I guess I mightve misunderstood and Im actually under manual review in LH disc and not from OSanc?",You should be verified now
Am I misunderstanding smth or how do I apply to get verified in LH discord after i get verified in Onyx? Thx in advance ❤️,If you head to <#471711348095713281> it will explain the verification process. There should be nothing blocking you from verifying since you a re already verified in OSanc.
Hello 👋 I started playing rotmg again and I just realised im blacklisted and I have no idea why. Can I get an appeal?,"Hello, I have removed the expels that were on your account. You're free to verify as normal."
"Hey there, I was wondering if it'd be possible to verify me for the LH  server.

"I was recently suspended for not being 2/8+ in an lh and then a fungal.

"Hello, for some reason I am blacklisted from verifying? It could be possible that I messed something up ofc, but I have no issue getting verified in other discord... Is there a way I can get manually verified or a reason why Im blacklisted? Ty for your time","Hey there, you were denied in our sister server osanc. You will have to get that sorted out before you can verify here."
I guess ROTMG is bugged i headed into a realm right after getting kicked,"Again, reach out to `keeyoung` if you'd like to discuss it further."
I was 2/8,"If you'd like to appeal your warn, dm `@keeyoung` on discord, however this is the proof of you being 1/8 in our run"

The RL Subwayfres kept harassing a trickster who was obviously new to decoying and kept calling him out during an entire void... really annoying and not nice.,This behaviour is of course not acceptable and not how RLs should act during our raids.
why did i get suspended?,"Hey man, looks like you were crashing a run and that is why you were suspended. If you would like the appeal that suspension feel free to reach out `oryxpumper` regarding your suspension."
Yeah I brought a paladin 0/8 to a MV but Why i should be 2/8 att and dex in a just dodge dungeon?,"Hey there chief, if you look at this message https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/379504881213374475/1009820585813086278 it explains that the reqs for mv are the same for halls."

Called USSR USRSSRS fast 2 times and then tells key to pop like wtf is that dog shit call?,"I understand, sorry again."
He told the key to pop instantly and I didn't get into the run,"Ah I see I’m very sorry that happened, we’ll let the upper staff know so they can speak to him about this, sorry that this happened to you."
I wanna report Oatmealeat's Kog,Can you tell us what happened?
!modmail grizzle kicking me for playing seasonal even tho i pop keys for the discord server,"Hey it appears you were 0/8, we appreciate you popping keys for us but you still need to meet the minimum requirements for every run, thanks and sorry this happened. In the future come at least 2/8 att and dex, T12/T4/T12/T4."
"One of ur security Strasz falsely claimed and gave a warning then took it off, so idk if he did or not but i got kicked for no reason bc i said in the raid tht i couldnt join the vc but im here, as in me with ogmur cuz thts what i notify the bot with, just a negative experience so pls tell whoever checks for kicking people to investigate more b4 kicking someone out of the blue for no reason.","You were on both your alt and your main account and both came up as crashing, and it is your responsibility to ask for help if you cannot reconnect to the VC by DM’ing a Raid leader or Security in the run for assistance.

Reqs for normal Void/Cult runs?,"Hi!  Normal reqs are T12 weapon, T4 ability, T12 armor, and T4 ring.  Because of the recent start of a new season, T11 weapons are allowed only until about another week (check https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/433117430588375040/1129067242181640293) for exact time."
i just used tickets to get into a run where they are apparently already at boss? Would love to get my tickets back since RL didnt close the AFK check until after they made it into the cult please,"Sounds pretty unlucky. It does look like you joined the vc in the same minute that it closed, are you sure you didn't just react and then miss the the run? I will see if the points can be refunded but in the future try to only react if you know you can make it to the run :)"
"I'd like to commend Donkeyhead, he's TRL but it felt like he's better than ARLs and even some RLs. Making good calls. Definitely wanna see him as verified raid leader in his next runs","Hey there chief, thanks for the positive feedback. I’m glad you’re enjoying his runs."

Oh no need thank you sorry im doing a ppe with a wizard and i was trying to get the spell so sorry for taking someones spot in the dungeon have a great day!,"No worries, have a great day."
i sorry,"No worries! It is just a warning that you broke the rules. If you wish to discuss it, you can message <@135866532138844160> ""tattoo"" (<@135866532138844160>)"

"Modmail: Hate to be the guy to send one of these, but Daayn was leading veteran fungals and left midway when someone in VC said there was a HM shatters starting -- they also leaked the loc in VC which isn't fair to the discord that was hosting that run. The key was pretty upset, naturally, and I thought it wasn't fair to promise a run then abandon it during the crystal cavern. Me and the key had to duo the rest of the dungeon as everyone else left.","Sorry for this experience, this is of course not how our raid leaders should behave and this does in no way represent our server. Thank you for sharing this with us and have a good day"
"Dossierone started an advanced Void so that he ""didn't have to make any calls."" He then says in afk-check that we dont have to follow reqs. He then takes a very long time to call location and confirm everything due to the fact he was threatening to abort the run if the security did not switch from her ogmur knight to an under reqs ninja, which she eventually did after 5 mins or so. He then makes little to no calls and says the r word in VC. How does my TRL application get denied if you are accepting people like this??","Sorry you had a poor experience with one of our RLs. This behavior is not something that we find acceptable from our staff team and I will take care of it personally. I apologize for the poor experience and hope this does not occur again, enjoy your night."

"how is that ax guy not a full rl already, great confident calls 👍",Thank you for the positive feedback! We will be sure to let him know. Have a great day!
"RL Legenmith called one single time and then popped key. his call was also unhelpful, being: ""US south........... 3 left bazar."" was a crashed location too so ~14 people missed. got called out for it in run by others and responded ""i dont care,"" total waste of my time to even try to show up to this guys runs if he doesn't care anyways","Sorry you experienced this. Thank you for the feedback, we will be sure to pass this on to the HRLs. Have a great day."
"On the server, I'm not verified as a member so I can't see runs or AFK checks but the Vi bot says that my accoutn has already been verified","Again, please DM an online security (with blue name) and they will assist you. Have a great day!"

can you remove the warning i got bc i was using the reqs,"You had a T11 weapon. Try to meet gear reqs at all times if possible, you can find them in <#379504881213374475> :)"
got removed from kanoins raid bc i switched from my cutlass to an  t11 flail for range. even tho ive done alot of voids today. when i asked why i got removed he was just rude af and making fun of me. got some clips of it. very unprofessional and bad behavior from a rl. he should be able to controll his anger and not make fun of others.,Sorry to hear that. We’ll make sure to have someone say something to Kanoin to correct his behavior
This is Sea isn't it,Always has been.

subwayfres bad pot again,"Hey while we understand this is frustrating he’s still in a learning role, so you’ll have to understand that. I would suggest if you want to reduce hitting pots only do vet runs from here on out, as ARL’s are still learning. Thank you for letting us know though and we’ll pass this info on."

"hello! please, can you cancel my suspension? first i was suspended because i didn't remember the rules. but this second time wasn't fair. i was sure that i was in call, just realize that i wasn't when the quest started and i was kicked. i also knew that candy armor was banned because of the "" -5 dex"" status, that's why i was using the cuband ring, which gives ""+5 dex"" status, equaling the dex status. please, consider my message. 5 days ban it's insane. if it were 2 or 3 days, would make more sense. but 5 days takes so long!! please, let me ride!!",If you wish to appeal contact <@213849524890894336>. Keep in mind you can use banned items as long as you have a swappout that is meeting our requirements but you can't equal the stats out in the way you have described. CC is banned so unless you have another armor you cannot use it.
"Yuki San is a RL for the people, I love this guy. Good RL, better dude.","Alright, thank you for the feedback I'll forward this to the HRL's. Do you have any additional information that we could use to understand more specifically what you enjoyed about his leading style?"

"I am communist China then, we need Ice Tombs. Right now. Don't make me apply for a presitigous Raid Leader role in the Public Halls to lead them. The people need to know the greatness of this dungeon and its loot. We ran so many only when the event was up, but now? Nothing. It makes no sense at all, why do we run Lost Halls without an event running around? Makes no sense to me. I love Ice Tombs. We need an influx of this dungeon, in fact someone just yesterday said they have 37 keys in the key-alerts channel! Please reconsider.","I do believe it is in this servers best interest if you apply for the glorious title of raid leader, or exalt leader. This way, you may lead any dungeon you wish; without fear.

"I'm confused, a lot of the people who got suspended at the same time as I have already been unsuspended, why do I have to wait 2 weeks and they don't? 2 weeks is a very long time during a void event, especially when I have no past issues with the server. I wasn't even in that guild for 2 weeks. I would greatly appreciate if you reduced the suspension","Some of your guildies were unsuspended earlier as I thought we would be lifting the suspension after you left the guild but we've decided to make sure you don't join back instantly to initiate this suspension, those people have been suspended again. I'm sorry that it led to this but the guild was warned beforehand and no actions in right direction were made so we had to blacklist it."

“ you’re not part of this run whenafk check ended”,If You're reacting as a Speacial React that gives priority Drag please make sure you're in lounge before reacting to the Priority react if you join when the VC opens up instantly and get disconnected this can happen due to a discord glitch that can happen due to discord latency meaning you actually didnt make it into the VC.
Is there something wrong with my account? I haven’t gotten any bans at all. I’ve tried getting in runs earlier this morning but I couldn’t so I thought it was bad luck.

My apologies for yesterday's incident. It won't happen again. I'm fairly sure my 12 hour suspension has elapsed. ViBot says I've been blacklisted from the Lost Halls server and can no longer verify. I don't recall breaking any rules since my suspension that would get myself permanently blacklisted from the server. More information on this would be greatly appreciated.,Leaving the server whilst suspended causes an automatic blacklist. Contact any online security and they will manually verify you :)

Did a void that was lead and started by fatty which he purposely nexuses from twice and blames a DC because its boring. Which idgaf who leads just stop playing hot potato with leading runs I dont want to hear it and it consistently messes up the flow of the run (having to rush to call out certain phases because no one wants to take over at first). Happened 2-3 times and the last time the person that took over just straight up let the void part just get overrun by minions before the 4 split even happened.,"Hey, I'm sorry you had bad runs with Fatty.

wondering why t13 katana isn't 1 point for vet runs,In vets the RL can choose what items they want to allow/not allow.
I dont really want to say this about an ARL because i get that they are still learning but I think Legenmith could do much better if he ghost lead or gets some more feedback. During mbc and void the rl would often make calls late or throw out guesses for calls and correct himself afterwards. Additionally it didnt seem like he was really paying attention to the boss fight as a whole and as a result missed mbc key calls and let a platform get overrun in void.,"Okay, thank you very much for the feedback. I'll forward this to the HRL's, if there's anything else you'd like to add or have any feedback for other staff members feel free to send it over. :) Hope you have a good day."
"Kanoin kicked me for under reqs when I had a 8 dps stat ring on but it wasnt enough even though on req sheet omni is a 8 dps stat ring, proceded to leave the run no problem and oryxpumper wants to give me a warning after dming me for being under reqs when I was clearly 3/4 dps items kanoin said t5 atk ring doesnt count like omni because it doesnt give me spd and health, Thought vet runs were dps related not how much hp or spd you have..",In vets you have to meet the gear requirements that the rl in question provides. If your item isn't there I'd recommend either not going or asking them before the run if they'll make an exception. Every item is there for a reason and that also goes for the one's that are not. If you still wish to appeal/talk about it contact them. Hope you have a nice day :)
bro but again i was in nexus and everyoen ran to the bazaar so i joined,"Just because everyone else is running towards a cliff to jump off of it, doesn’t mean you should too!"

I would like him to explain to me why I didn't understand him and he doesn't answer my messages- I even told him I was on VC and he could explain and he didn't say anything...,"This warning was because you were leeching in the Davy Jones during the run. I recommend you at least ask the RL in chat if you can leech, for things like going to the bathroom or getting water/standing up, or lagging.

Hello! I'm not a person who likes confusion or anything. I was on an event raid and the Raid Leader gave me a warning that I didn't understand. I'm not here to make trouble game by game for over 12 years. I already have a son playing this for fun and now a Moderator/Raid Leader gives me a warning for no reason and doesn't explain. Even if it's because I wasn't going with them we were in a Davy Jones and I warned that my discord was with Lag. I would like him to explain it to me or someone or until they withdraw the warning. Thanks,"Hey there, sorry to hear there was some confusion between you and the RL. First and foremost, this was just a warning which is simply used to let you know you did something against the rules without having to directly DM you. We appreciate your appreciation for the game, and our server, and understand where you are coming from with your concern here. If you feel that this was unjustified, please reach out to @'OryxPumper `OryxPumper` in discord DMs in order to appeal the warning and get it removed. If you feel that he is not being reasonable, then you can reach out to any online security (or higher) and we will assist you."

How to remove blacklisting ?,You will have to rejoin the Oryx Sanctuary discord server and get unblacklisted there. The blacklist did not come from this server so it cannot be removed by this server. Once it is removed you should be able to verify normally through the bot here.

yeah I'd like to speak to a higher-up. this is an unjust suspension. Hiding character??? I was actually typing in chat lol. also on a 4/4 character.

I'm not accepting this warnign and would like it removed. When i entered the run I asked if this was a discord run and i needed to leave and got no response. I didn't know it was a discord run as i got no response nor people telling me to leave in a serious manner so how was I supposed to know this was a lost halls run and suppsed to leave.

Is it possible for me to get veteran raider by sending a screenshot of my runs logged by the funman bot to a security+?,It is preferred to limit screenshots of stats as they can easily be manipulated. You can un-private your realmeye graveyard and/or send screenshots of living character's Lost Halls completions to a security. <@371489458027233280> (<@371489458027233280>) will be happy to assist you should you DM them.

"For advanced runs, you lose a point for having t11 gear but why is that the case when t11 gear doesn't meet the reqs for normal runs?

oh sorry :c,No worries! Have a great day! 😊
sorry i meant vet verified lol,You are vet verified
bro it's ice tombs 😭,I know :( but it's crashing
am i allowed to leave vc,"If you are in a raid, then you are not allowed to leave the VC unless you die/nexus/the raid ends."
"ok , here is where you make a judgement call or just straight up give someone a warning . Let's say for the arguments sake You are in a pixelated game , playing chilling after work , you log in saw a run happening INSIDE THE GAME mind you (and its an event run also an ice tomb where it is the most brainded dungeon in the game) , join , dont troll ,  bring a good character , and you're playing your game then suddenly bam , !!!!warning issued !!!! you have violated a rule . you dont even know which server it is , you dont know what you have done , not a message , nothing. just gives a warning in the 6 th chain , cmon man i was playing this game when this server started , when lost halls was introduced , when sadlyfe was doing runs . not a single message ? like a whisper or something saying dude can you leave you are ruining our experience as a server by not being in the voice channel for this tomb that you just stumbled upon . is this not where you make a human judgement and say well maybe a warning is too much ill just ask him or ignore it since its a ice tomb and there isnt even max people in ........ sorry for the rant , i dont even care about the warning its just the way it was done .","I get where you're coming from and it makes sense, you're just trying to chill and play the game but the rule of thumb is that organised runs whether they're Discord, guild or just friends are typically done in bazaars, meaning if you see a run happen there it's a good idea to not follow the players in. Even if you didn't have malicious intentions we can't really allow one person to crash as that would cause everyone to follow in those footsteps and then you'd have scuffed runs where, even in an icetomb you'd have people dying left right and centre. We do often do silent runs but they are solely for dungeons that couldn't go horribly wrong if calls were not apparent. If you still wush to appeal your warning feel free to contact `'Espeon` <@244208105699803140>"
"crashing in an event run , i was in realm saw people running in bazaar went in and there was an ice tomb  what a crime bro","That is unfortunate indeed, but we politely ask raiders not to join in such raids without being in the Discord voice channel. Whenever you see a large group of people running towards a bazaar it generally is pretty clear that it is a run. Please get in touch if you would like to discuss this further."
Thanks for the help,I removed the blacklist for your account. You should be able to reattempt verification now
"Daayn cant organise shit, same loc all the time so crashers, and then calls new loc as ""eu west, north west, right"" ???",I'll make sure HRLs know about this. I was there as well.
I might have verified in the past under the username Diwash. Is there a way to wipe the only account so I can re-verify?,DM any online security and they will be able to assist you.
Why was my verification denied,"Hi, feel free to contact `*ihwa` <@494317724160360448> :)"
Blib sucks,Blib does indeed suck.
Celoso not directing the group in ice tomb and was a knight that didn't even stun the bosses barly talked threw leading seems like a follower more than a leader,"Hey there, sorry for the negative experience with Celoso, I'll forward this to the HRL team so it can be looked into.

"run at around 7:15 with Kanoin as RL, was very mad at group in void and created a negative atmosphere. many raiders in chat were complaining about his attitude as he was talking about how bad we were","Yeah that doesn't sound very nice and definitely something we don't want our RL's doing, thank you for the feedback, I will pass this on to the HRL team now :) I hope it doesn't happen again to you!"

truly the worst run i've been in in months cause bad dps. 10/10 would do again just for lionlord ❤️,"Would you be able to expand upon the feedback? Was the run bad purely because of the lack of ""dps"" or was there an issue with his leading capabilities? Any additional infomation helps us out a lot :)"
"he calls things better than all the rls ive had before, like what shots do and stuff like that","That is great to hear. Thank you for the positive feedback, we will be sure to pass this along to our HRLs to let him know. Have a great day!"
This is for modmail hi I just wanted to say yorrick is a really good rl that is all,Hey! I'm glad to hear that you're enjoying his runs. Is there anything specific that he does that stands out from others?
"Hello, i wanted to ask if it is still possible to become a raid leader and if so when and where can you apply?","Hi! At the current moment trial raid leader applications aren’t open. They open periodically, and you can fill out the form whenever they roll around. You can find out when TRL apps are open in <#433117430588375040>."
"i didnt mean to press this: You are currently under manual review for veteran verification. If you do not hear back within 48 hours, Please reach out to a Security or higher",No worries!
but oongus bottus gives early loc for supporters,"You can always ask the RL for location as well, if you are an early react. They will see you in the VC early and should tell you."
why vibot doenst send early loc for supporters,"Hey there, supporters get early VC (be in lounge, you will get dragged early) 10 times every 24 hours. This does not give you early location, however you are in the VC early therefore you should not ever miss."
I want it to be known that FameTime is an absolute fucking beast of an RL and y'all should be proud,"Good to hear that you're enjoying his runs. I'll let the HRL team know, thanks for the feedback."
"I would like to report Blib for commiting hate crimes during Tubs's void run, the run started nicely and really calm in which every raider was  having fun and being really social until this disgrace of a human being named Blib has decided to parse and kick one of out greatest friends, he has kicked him for the awful reason that he only had T6 gear, like how is he supposed to get better gear if u kick him from runs? Anyways after this incident every single raider in the group has decided to team against this awful human being and commit hate crimes against what Blib has done to this poor man, i would like to see this awful human not only get demoted but be straight up sent to prison for life and no bail and i would also like to receive the prison he is sent to so i can be the only person from the outside who sees him, and every single day i will make his life as miserable as i can with simply just words for commiting this awful case of racism against a simple realm of the mad god player who was simply trying to enjoy a void run.","Thank you Geo, Blib has been scheduled for execution. We are erecting a statue in the PubHalls headquarters dedicated to the poor soul that was unrightfully kicked."
"BusterBudy is by far one of the BEST RL's I Have ever had the pleasure of  running with. He provided plenty of helpful calls, interacted with the raiders in a helpful and fun manner. Overall, great RL. Needs a promotion.","Good to hear that you're enjoying his runs. I'll let the HRL team know, thanks for the feedback."
"not sure if previous message went through but pierce need to learn how to call big boys and stuff, terrible calls and we lost 20 people in a 40 man run",Thank you for your feedback; we'll pass this along to an HRL and look into what happened.
"Never did this before and idk how this works, but I can't keep it in anymore. Tubs runs amazingly good raids and I wish to share that with the mod team. The calls are on point and the personality is the best. He makes us feel valued no matter the circumstances and joining his raids is pretty much the highlight of my day. I hope this message reaches someone who can let him know that he's the best. Thanks!","Hey there, thanks for the king words I also Agree Tubs is an amazing person I'll be sure to pass your kind words onto him!"
Tubs led a great forest maze today. i was in tears.,"Eye absolutely agree with you. Tubs is an absolutely wonderful lad, you have a good eye, Eye. He has been given a kiss on the cheek."
During an Ice Tomb Chain someone by the name of  Fusqq popped an LOD . Dont want him in trouble just want the message to be told and yall to do whatever is necessary,"Thanks for your report. Punishments for popping random keys in raids are at the discretion of the raid leader. The key pop in this case was not particularly disruptive, so the RL did not issue a punishment."
LonsonTV forgot about the wanderer on a modded cult key and popped the next key early,kk
I want to give a good mod mail to Tubs because of how nice he is while doing his runs,Thank you for the positive feedback!  We'll be sure to pass it along :)
I just wanted to compliment Heavydk for his efficient cult runs. he used hp scaling and great group direction to speed up the runs.,Thank you for the positive feedback!  We'll let an HRL pass it along :)

"Just... yikes. Really weird comments throughout the runs, talking about cum and shit, saying stuff like ""it's pride month so we can't make fun of gay people but that he doesn't give a shit after that"" lol. Calling out raiders a lot, sometimes incorrectly, and his humor was based entirely on making fun of people - which is totally fine if it's with people you know, but to a bunch of raiders who know nothing about a person it just looks really bad. Just really mean and vulgar and should probably tone it down.","I’m so sorry you had this experience, we will relay this to an HRL immediately so they can speak to him about his behavior.

I just asked to get dragged back in and then got kicked with no communication and he didn't respond to any of my whispers were i simply asked for help. 0 communication","I’m terribly sorry you had this experience, we will reach out to MNX to make sure he’s watching his messages for things like that so you don’t get kicked by accident, I apologize this happened to you."
I didn't crash i got banned from the LH,"I didn't ban you, I just gave you a warning. The bot showed you were never in the voice chat for the run so you were kicked. It's not a big deal, you can still attend runs just try to make it to the vc before joining runs in the future :)"

I’ll make sure to let an HRL know so that they can talk to him about his behavior.
"Hanagasumi refuses to make vcs for his ice tomb runs, I asked him too because the servers he is using isn't good for eu players and on top of that I have pretty bad load times because of my pc not being the greatest.

I’ll make sure to let an HRL know so that they can talk to him about his behavior.
you actually have to do something with Hanagasumi just calling event ice tombs in chat and not even creating vc! were reaching 150 per bazaar,I am incredibly sorry for the inconvenience. I’ll make sure to let an HRL know so that they can talk to him about his behavior.
"hanagasumi has no idea how to direct raids, dude posted the location publically and got 180 people waiting for a single ice tomb chain, which obviously left 130 sitting there. this is also glancing over the fact that this mf had us waiting for the raid for at least 30 minutes, pinging numerous times throughout it",I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience. I’ll make sure to let an HRL know so that they can talk to him about this happening.
"I'm not sure if youll be the same mod or security that answers my mod mail, but i'm just saying if everyone wants to do it for the event rn then why would u host a chain like that without a vc","Same one, I didn't realise how long the dungeon actually takes so I will have a word with him and see if the chain can be shortened. Vcless runs are often preferred during events like this where people will typically be running hundreds of the same dungeon."
"can you do something about hangasumi, everyone wants to do ice tomb events rn and hes just gatekeeping keys with a 14 chain withouta vc",We allow rl's to do vcless runs for non exalt dungeons and a 14 chain doesn't seem too long. If the chains get to an absurd length then we will intervene. I don't see how he his gatekeeping as anyone can go to the runs.

I would have not cared if you just didnt mention it but you had to repeat it like 4 times that you called it in time and that inciting that it was our fault. I am not mad.

Obviously its fine since in the end it is my fault for not nexusing.","Thank you for your feedback. The HRL team have been made aware, take care."
hi i put the code in my description,"You're now verified, happy raiding :>"
The sound was att max volume. He was speaking in a volume which his mic didnt seem to pick up. Maybe not his fault. But still a very late call with confusing commands. No worries.,"I've never had any issues with my Discord or mic for over 3 years and have never changed any of the settings, they are all custom to benefit the volume I speak at to help raiders hear me ( which I know is quite quiet). I called the yellow whip and fractal before they came so raiders would know to avoid them and therefore I don't know what call you are referring to which was late. Myself and other RL's do hundreds of runs to ensure these things are done correctly, I couldn't lead if people had trouble hearing me and if my calls were late causing people to die I wouldn't be leading that dungeon. I'm sorry if you missed my callouts but I don't think it was a problem on my end. I will keep an eye out in the future though and see if this issue reoccurs. Sorry again, hope you understand and have a nice a day."

Reactionist needs to take rling just a lil more seriously. left at the biggening of void then turned mic back on midway through. whole run was pretty disorganized. Hes good when hes doing it........,"Thanks for letting us know about that, the HRL team will talk to him after we inform them about it. Have a nice day and hopefully, muting during void wont be a problem anymore."
I meant specifically prejoining in large amounts rather than whether they can attend raids or not haha. Of course it would be silly to tell them whether they can or cannot play,Yeah just please understand that they are welcome to attend as is anyone else
"Sorry I think I might've explained poorly. I mean lately with all the void runs, the channel hasn't even opened and theres like 20 people in there most of which are rls or arls or whatever and it just sucks because it means only 20 of us ""plebs"" can join so its easy to miss even with an autoclicker and everything going","Understood, I thought you meant joining over the cap. They are more than free to join runs and we will not place a limit on how many of them can join, because they are free to enjoy the game however they want. I apologise on their behalf for the lack of initiative, but we will not police such matters."

Hi. just wanted to say i got early drag into a kog chain for Nitro. VC got closed and ppl dragged till 52/50 and then key was popped at 56+ppl.  Apparently 10 crashers therefore i missed .

"Acestate RL fungal run modmail. 1st key went well. 2nd key was crap. Forgets to call 75% drill and calls at 100%, group nearly misses. Forgets to call bottom fractals, 2 8/8s die. I type ""late call"" in public chat. Acestate tries to cope by denying that he called it late, and then late calls the 2nd fractal right after that. Luckily no raiders died that time.  Good job. Deserved my first modmail of any run ever.","Sorry for this experience, but keep in mind no one is perfect ^^"
"Reactionist's fs runs are full of crashers outside bazaar, told him the names, my guy didn't even bother and just continues.",Thank you. We’ll say something to him about not using the same server multiple runs in a row
"I reacted to daze on Balloonpop cult and there were 70 plp trying to get in a 45 person channel and I didnt get in so i asked for a drag, which they granted me and then proceed not to wait for me and pop before I even got there missing a 3 chain","Well the run doesn't revolve around you, it is kinda on your own accord to get in before the vc is full. The vc is capped at 45 because the dungeon can only have 50 people and it allows some room for crashers so no one in vc misses."

What a mature response. My point is further proven. Thanks for taking the matter seriously and responding in an appropriate way.,"We allow people to afk when they need to, we are aware that there are often other things going on in peoples lives other than Realm. They should not have let someone crash however but you should have also met our requirements, I will follow up on this but I think if you're going to complain about people crashing you should at least be meeting reqs."
"I contest this, RL said he didnt care if people AFK'd, or leeched in the VC, He even allowed a personal friend of his to crash. I was doing my part on a seasonal. I'm sick of the double standards of the RL's. You have no integrity.",I'm sick of seasonal's coming 1/8 to runs D:

"Positive Modmail/Complain Time: Just ran a few chains with Straszman doing some Fame Cults and it was decent vibes-- not quick runs, but decent runs. Strasz was chilling and we had a hard reset, came back to a new headcount, new voice channel and new additional RL's who joined. We were running it kinda show, probably around 13-14 minutes and then on the first key (of 2 since they were taking too long for the 30 minute policy), RainyRose said in chat that he wasn't going to do the next chain because its taking way to long. I, as well as some other raiders, made some honest comments about nobody cares to hear what his opinion is-- yeah, you can complain about it but when it's coming from an RL in the tone of which he said, it's just uncalled for. I said ""nobody asked"" and it's true, he doesn't have to run them but to tell us about his departure is just out of place and seems like it's trying to engage and provoke a negative response. The other raiders agreed, there was 3 others that I recall saying ""nobody cares"" and then when Rainy responded to my comment saying ""nobody asked you to response"" and then ""@Resn"" me and then someone else responded to him saying ""nobody asked you to respond to him responding"" and it was just all cringe-- why trying to ping me in-game chat? It doesnt work, it just looks confrontational and just isn't called for-- furthermore, he's a shitty RL, he was talking mad shit about OryxPumper last week during his runs about how Oryx ""always likes to  bitch about everything and whines when he doesnt get his way"" and ""he whines when people don't stun red"" (inside cult). Sadly, I wish I would have recorded this because I know Rainy would be getting fired-- at least the very minimum targeted and hated because I would send it to all the RL's. That's uncalled for, to talk shit about another RL behind their backs to raiders. Staszman told us he apologizes for ""that RL coming in and ruining the vibes of this chill chain"" and that was it. Just my two cents.","I have read it, and sent it to the HRLs. Thanks for letting us know and sorry that you had a shit experience"

"hey instead of having 4 rls in one run hoarding 16 event keys, why not divide it into 2 group to accommodate others.

We will personally handle the situation to make sure this does not happen again.

this superbimp rl is kinda racist,Would you mind further explaining your experiences with him?
"Hello, I'd like to give some praise about our newest trl, Kanoin. I have absolutely loved having him as an rl. he is attentive, entertaining, and makes really helpful calls, even when they are not needed.

none of them have this set though because it's from 2021,It probably has to do with the set being not that great as well as the extreme rarity of it.
is this 4/4? with ogmur I outdamage every class in the game with 4/4 sets.,Being 4/4 is determined by checking the requirements set by the raid leader usually with posting a picture defining the accepted sets. There are no universal 4/4s. I hope this clears up the confusion!
I'm an old member that's been denied trying to get back in the discord. I was active in 2021 and opened several keys. I dont see a reason for the denied verification anywhere.,"Hey there, you were denied by <@327078279586512907> (Kuvu#6270) So you'll have to reach out to them to appeal this."

im blackmailed from lost halls but its been years and i dont even think ive done anything to deserve getting blackmailed so can i get unblackmailed,It looks like you were blacklisted because the account you were verified with was linked to another discord. What account are you trying to verify with on this discord?
"bluwve is a kind rl, i was being mean in his run but he took it with getting upset. his map reading might need a little work but he is a very good human.",Glad you had such a positive experience. We’ll make sure the HRLs commend him on his kindness
May you please explain how i can be verified to play within the server?,just reach out to any online security for further assistance
"Hi im wanting to get back into rotmg as i havent played in a long while due to work taking up most of my time, im trying to get verified however it says i have been blacklisted by someone who is no longer part of the server? May i ask what i have been banned for, and may i request to join back?",Any time verification is denied the user associated with that is blacklisted to prevent them from attempting to circumvent the verification system. It's not the same as a ban and you can message any Security staff for help getting verified in the future.
"the ""reason"" said dms",correct
right click on them i had to find their username first dingo 💀,im assuming you didn't read the last half of the message
and how am i supposed to find someones name through discord without @ing them?,"right click on them and click message, or if you need to @ them you can do it in <#343704644712923138>"
I accidentally clicked the verification button,no worries good sir
"hello, I just participated in a raid with the RL ""Fattywww"" I have to say, he has been by far my worst experience of a RL, and I'd like to say i've participated in a lot of raids in this server and others. He was completely silent in the MBC boss fight, and completely uncaring. Called out pretty much nothing, result in several people dying, and lots of players forced to nexus due to his lack of callout to those who might have been much less accustomed to the dungeon. Once MBC was dead, and we made our way into the void, he blamed everyone remaining for why we had so little people. He didn't give some basic callout at the start of void, and i know this is probably a rookie thing that people know, but he didn't give a general countdown on when the entity was to be active, and several people died because of it. His tone was incredibly monotone the entire raid, and seemingly got angry at the players for why everything was going so poorly in terms of bad phases, bad key spots on MBC. etc. I do not cherich being the guy who has to say something, but this complete lack of care and utter negligence is ridiculous. Certainly not an RL I would return in the future for raids. There are so many great RL's on this server, but he simply makes the whole look bad.","Our HRL team will be notified and handle the situation appropriately, thank you for bringing this to our attention."
"Hi I am reaching out to modmail today referring to RL fattywww, started a rush LH, hit pots no biggie made it only losing 2. Once we got to boss was completely silent, sighing anytime something wasn't being done efficiently and reluctantly started RLing the boss. We lost FIFTEEN people and 2 8/8's died while our RL gave silent treatment. After we got into the void someone got instant shotgunned by void boss because, I assume, was due to the fact RL didn't say anything like every other one does about it starting or dex effusions or anything. Proceeded to get a horrible run of void that was saved by 4 back to backs of void going middle. Only reason we made it to be honest. Bad RL bad attitude, don't start a run if you dont wanna run it is my opinion as a previous RL. Cheers!","Our HRL team will be notified and handle the situation appropriately, thank you for bringing this to our attention."
"It is annoying for me because I feel as if I did everything I was supposed to and had sent appropriate sets, but I wasted 15+ minutes to never get dragged and to never get an explanation. I don't always get a lot of time to play, so stuff like that sucks. If I did something wrong, I would like to know so I could not do it again in the future. I don't know if this is normal behavior or not, but it wasn't very cool to me.","Sorry this happened, it's quite likely he was just getting a lot of DMs and took the number of people he needed for each role on a first come, first served basis *or* by the quality of their gear and for whatever reason your huntress didn't make the cut. Unfortunately due to having a limited number of RLs and slots in each run as well as thousands of raiders it can sometimes be competitive to get into runs and this may happen as a biproduct of that. We hope you have a better experience getting into our runs in the future."
"Hi, how do I go about getting unblacklisted?",You should be able to verify now
";contact I'm looking to get verified for veteran runs. I'm not quite sure if i meet the reqs on my current acct, as my old one got perma-banned.

"SCUFFED; different modmail, different situation: <@905853732795850803> put up an afk check for a void with modded key with 15% chance of extra spooky, he ran the run with no tricksters and verbally saying that in vc (i told him in game he can ping for one next time in rsa), raiders were peeking like fuck when told numerous of times not to, welp.. we got a spooky.. and then he died because he tried to body decoy on edge (sadge rip rl 8/8)  but then there was nobody else in the vc that could run (an eo took over, <@251699722820124673>) and he could barely do it because he runs cults and THEN another spooky showed up.. so there is an EO running a LH with 2 spookies and no tricksters. no raiders died thankfully but this was scuffed and could easily have been avoided..",This sounds like a very unfortunate circumstance. Good to see that people were willing to step up and help. We’ll talk to yanibenim about making sure he has the necessary reacts for runs in the future. Have a nice day!
"im trying to get verified with this account because i lost the other one and I have all the requests completed, i have a close to 8k base fame knight with the items that i need and i have last location set to nobody, trying for like 2 days and now im blacklisted for no reason, can you guys please check me out because i would really like to join some runs with you.",Message <@494317724160360448> to get manually verified as they are the person who denied your initial request.

"Failed his recent void by not making proper callouts to kill void minions on other platforms, causing a 2 shrink, ignored raiders callouts like crusades in chat, continued to sing instead of making callouts, refused to swallow his pride by ignoring raiders again and again who were telling him the route to mbd (one of the raiders were actually at mbd)  and continued to go left, also led with low laptop battery and it died during mbc recently. Many deaths under his leadership. Pretty ignorant and childish. Why is he blaming raiders for his shortcomings as a shit leader lol 😹 😹 😹 😿😿😿😿😿👎👎👎👎","Sorry about this, we will have a chat with him and hopefully the runs improve. Thank you for the feedback."
Superblimp is underqualified idk why he is even allowed to raid this guy is retarded,Do you have an example of his behavior? Would be helpful so that it can be corrected by an HRL.

"Fattywww void skips feel dangerous to me. He only calls out directions and usually stays in the middle or back of the group.

"this is not mod mail per say but i did no know where else to put this, vi bot when trying to react yes to if you have a key or not it fails onces then lets you react.

If its the emote reacts that is a discord issue and there is nothing we can do, If it is the buttons we can bring it up to the devs but it probably just because the command is still running and processing everything so it needs an extra second before it moves onto the next thing"
Atarashii,adds up
I can send screenshot to someone if needed,What is your Realm of the mad god ign?
have not heard back within the 48 hours,Anymore info you got for us? All I see if you joined the Discord and modmailed us.
thx uwu,aw hecks naw
pls verify,sir yes sir
warning? i left as i was asked lmao,Talk to <@213849524890894336> if you wish to appeal.

hey my previous discord account got hacked that had Ldx verified on it i want to change the verification to this account,Reach out to any online security for assistance with that.
Fattywww is a very lazy RL and also just rude.  Runs with him have been a nighmare so far but as soon as another RL takes over they are immediately better. He makes minimal callouts during boss fights after the skip is successful despite it being obvious a lot of people in the LH are new/needing help. This makes them very difficult as half the people seem to have no idea what they are doing even as someone who does know what to do.,We are very sorry to hear that. Your view on the situation is valid. This feedback has been passed on to the HRLs.
Can I register my realm account to an alt discord account? I can provide a screenshot in vault if needed,If you’d like to switch discord accounts you will have to reach out to a security and they will be able to assist you in that.
tam good rl,Vincent good raider
"Is that seriously my only option? GPU is blaming me solely for his death, there is no chance he is going to appeal it. Not only that, but according to the server's rule page I did not do anything that warranted a one week suspension, even not listening to RL when it comes to switching to tiered seal.","hio bud, this is Rulerzeus one of the Mods, I agree that this is at the very least an overreaction. Myself or one of the Officers will most likely be reaching out to you soon regarding the issue. We are apologize that this issue has occurred and will do our best to figure out what is best"
necromancer 8/8,Head over to <#471711348095713281> and follow the instructions given to verify.
"Hello, I was banned for a week for using oreo instead of tiered seal in a Shatters. The RL died the same run and likely just took his anger out on me. I was 23/25 exalts with 83k fame and did not want to risk losing my character. I don't think a week is justifiable!",You are welcome to attempt to appeal the suspension with the RL that suspended you.
yeah but like what else would u be doing in the server besides actually using it to run dungeons (raiding)? feels weird to me to have them seperate and not referring to eachother,We have text channels
still pretty confusing that u guys got 2 seperate rules pages when they dont refer to one another,I assume you're referring to `#rules` and `#raiding-rules` which are as stated rules for the server and rules for in game raiding.
"I heard that this guy has never gotten any positive modmail which is just absurd so I've decided to change that. I've only been in like 4 runs in with this dude, at least one person dies in every single one, and last run there was a quintuple massacre, but this RL is fucking awesome. Amazing energy, being in vc is a treat when he's around, and shows genuine remorse and shit when people die. S tier RL.",Ye idk if that's a good thing but ty for the feedback! I will forward this to the hrls :>
omg... my bad i guess...... only just noticed u guys have 2 sets of rules.. xD quite confusing,Ah sorry I read your modmails in chronological order lol
am i missing something?,In `#raiding-rules` it says that you will be suspended if you are crashing and even explains what crashing is. If you still wish to appeal your suspension contact <@164887742134616064> `Ruler#5546`
yo can i get help with verification,To begin your verification process you will need to make every one of yyour Realmeye settings public apart from the bottom two which must be private. When this is done you can head over to `#Get-verified` and re-react to the tick mark. If you are still having issues feel free to contact any online security :)
I dced for a run that i used tickets for. Can i get the 30 tickets reimbursed pls?,"Your points are refunded, have a good day mate. 👍"
"This raid leader constantly doesn't give calls, complains about random stuff, and honestly ruins the vibe. Also, he doesn't really give warning for loc. I had to really listen and turn him up loud to hear it. He says it extremely fast, and doesn't articulate what hes saying. Its hard for me to know when hes calling a server. He acts like its a chore to do raids, and would just say ""ugh lost halls"" or ""ugh raiders"". Just really annoying to do raids with when he makes it seem like we are a chore to him.","That sounds very annoying, sorry to hear that. Forwarded to the hrls ! ty"
threatens to kick/suspend players constantly as a joke but makes it seem serious,ye he do be a bit pepega thanks for the fb :)

"dude got shafted on no mseals and no tricks, definitely not his fault there but some of his calls were late and just general communications saying ""dodge and stuff like that"".. like, we know (some of us do) but there could be a new player in here and your calls are going to either make it or break it for them.",Thanks for the fb :)

I’m struggling to get in any runs because of this discord’s method of joining vc. I was spam clicking join and accidentally hit leave call after I join. It’s a little frustrating and i’m not upset with the discord staff at all. Simply is there anyway that the people who work on the bot’s could add a system to the server for whoever reacts to the headcount/participation reaction will be allowed to join vc and people who don’t react can’t. It would just make it a lot more fair. I’ve been trying to join runs all seasonal to get past this 1 void challenge and it’s proving to be impossible to get in this vc. I appreciate the help and services y’all provide thank you!,Headcounts are simply to gauge how many raiders we have and if we have keys/essential classes. Feel free to read this if you're having trouble connecting to runs 
"Hey, how do i go about appealing for getting removed off the blacklist from Lost Halls, I believe the reason i got blacklisted for not being able to verify properly because I didn't understand the difference between ""last known location"" and ""last seen location"" on realmeye when i was verifying?",You will need to contact <@727238620809003178> `Tamply`.

is the plague doctor priest set allowed in advanced runs?,We haven't made an official decision yet but just ask the RL. They may allow it if you're polite 😄
ProXtream,Thank you. We’ll let an HRL know so they can talk to him about it
tell your RLs to check bazzars before calling them,Do you know which RL did this?
thanks for your support 🙂 and sorry about that,dont apologise mate take care
i tell him that i only have that one (i thought i was equipped with the t13),"saying you have one may have lead to confusion. please also note that you were not issued any sort of punishment. in the future please try to communicate clearly, in a way that can not be misunderstood. that way, we can determine when staff are actually being malicious."
yes,"when he asked you for a swap, what did you tell him"
nop,and did he ask you for a swap?
had a t13 morning star and a t9 wand at the time (probably he got confused because i said ''i only have this one i think i was equiped with the t9 wand) but yeah sad.,sorry to hear this. did he trade you to check?

oh i see thanks for resolving my worries have a great day :),you too bless you
im retarded but why does it say membership since 05.04 when its 04.05,"because they're using the usa dates, the americans think that the date system that only they use is the universally standard one. don't worry about it bro, it took me a second too. take care!"
but like i bought this like 15-20 mins ago and checked my subscription options of disord and noticed it says that it ends tomorrow which is not really a whole month but just a day so im a little concerned about it,hello there! the 4th of june is a month from today.
"Nacnudd's run has been insightful, gives a glimpse of map reading in halls",Thanks for letting us know. Map reading is indeed very interesting and Nacnudd is the best on that <:love:514443048533622820>

"Ches is a very good rl, makes all the proper calls and makes sure that even new people can keep up. He also is a lot of fun to join in raids and has a great sense of humor :)","Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed his runs! I'll be sure to pass your kind words to the HRL Team."
"raid leader ches is amazing. a lot of great and easy runs, and very easy to focus in his runs. with his guiding we ran thru so many voids. i felt like a warrior in greece.","Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed his runs! I'll be sure to pass your kind words to the HRL Team."
100% enjoying his runs,That’s great to hear!
ches is best rl,I agree! What about his runs do you enjoy in particular?
"sorry, i dont understand, my old discord was on my phone but dont have access to the email anymore",anyone with the security role (blue colour name)
"Hi, my old discord which i dont have access to anymore is verified can i get my new one verified pls",reach out to any online security ^^
sorry i meant kaibi. whoever rl was leading in 2nd fullskip in chain was a jerk,Sorry to hear that. I’ll make sure to let an HRL know so they can correct this behavior.
"My verification doesnt seem to be going through, it is getting stuck on my realmeye page. I did used to rl for you guys a couple years ago if that helps with anything. My account name is Squarewiz",I see - this is very likely a common Realmeye graveyard issue. Please reach out to any security and we'll sort this out 🙂
then rl didnt say anything and said no kick (rl was oryxpumper),"im very sorry that this happened to you and the person responsible will be punished, thank you for bringing this to our attention."
"Apparently old discord account got deleted so I made a new one but I cant verify because my old discord is connected to my ROTMG account, Is there any way I can get rid of the verification on my old account and use it on this one instead?",hi yea just dm any security !
"Snake is the greatest RL of ALL TIME, I cannot recommend them enough. The amount of energy we had in those 50+ sewers runs was legendary.",hiya ty for the possible feedback ! we'll let snake and the HRLs know :p
"im trying to verify but it is causing me so much trouble, I do not understand where to my the code in my ""realmeye description"".","hi, you came to the right place. basically you go to realmeye.com, login, and put the code into the light grey box on ur profile (says edit in it)"
snake is the best rl,hiya ty for the possible feedback ! we'll let snake and the HRLs know :p
"I think arl's should be able to chain certain keys such as cults, nests, ect, maybe not voids because those require additional prep but i mean cults are as easy as chaining ots","Hey, we appreciate your input. In fact arls can chain non-halls/shatts like nests and fungals. They just can’t chain the others because they need to obtain rl first for the safety of the group. Hope that helped."
"is having a t11 wand really an insta suspend, no warning? genuinely curious about this","Hey, if you'd like to appeal it you will have to dm the person that suspended you (Rulerzeus)"
i dont know why i was blacklisted? i dont ever think i was in this server,"Hey, contact any online security for help."
Hi modmail could i have help verifying,"You were denied by Trevict, reach out to him to appeal."
"not sure if you can do anything, but i dont support that kind of DM","Thank you for letting us know, wooodred. We will look into this and take the appropriate action."
"I NEVER mod mail because I feel like it's kind of pointless and also kind of cringe but I'm trying to vent because I'm genuinely pissed-- I'm 2 cults away from 5/5 exalt and this RL decides to say ""wink wink if someone were to pop an extra key I couldn't let you guys go in alone"".  The RL had popped a cult, ran a raid check and then ran it and then decided to do MDB? I rubber banded and had to nexus so I'm already pissed I couldn't do the *CULT* that was posted but then to see the other cults ran because of the ""wink wink"" and raiders bringing them for him. The RL is ;Tam and he seems like an alright guy but dude, just hard reset and post another so you're not shitbagging the rules and fucking people over.","Hey, we apologize for the experience. This will be passed onto the HRLs and they will talk to Tam for you. Thank you and have a nice day !"
how can i go out from blacklist?,"Hey, I've removed the expel on your account. You're free to verify as normal."
wasnt a discussion someone was giving something away and i accepted i tried to PM them but they weren't accepting,"Only post trade offers in <#347884995353903114> , keep any discussion, questions, or offers towards someone else's trade in DMs or another channel"
I think i need manual verification,"Hey there, have you checked out <#343711922417434634> ?"
well i was dragged to a vet channel atleast,Okay I understand. Thanks for letting me know!
sp Utahmiee is a lag brain thats two dungeoins ive missed today bc hes accidently said wrong loc the first time and i connect to the wrong one then by the time i get to the right ine it blinks ithin 4 secs,"Hey there, sorry to hear about you missing the run twice because of an RL mistake. I’ve forwarded this information to the HRL team."
of course i remember :o i saw you in keypop server the other day too 🕵️‍♂️,Imagine not saying hi..
"Had a complete mental break down during the run, started by making everyone soft reset after he brought the wrong character, which upset a lot of the raiders. Near constant rambling, proceeded to spend the next 15 minutes talking about chains or something? After the soft reset he started saying ""I am a fucking idiot"" over and over again like 20 times instead of just moving on and leading the run. During the four runs that I did he maybe only made like 7 calls, the rest of it was just gibberish. Past that point when raiders were getting visibly frustrated with him he began repeatedly saying ""I don't give a fuck if you modmail me"" and commenting that it doesn't do anything and that it won't matter. Then kept telling people ""if you don't like it nexus"", and that he wouldn't get demoted, just get a talking to. Constant arguing back and forth with us, was absolutely atrocious to listen to. I don't know, maybe he is totally fine normally, but this was hands down one of the worst raiding experiences I have had on the server, had to nexus before the chain was over because I just couldn't take listening to anymore of it.","I'm sorry you made this experience in one of our raids, this is not the standard for our runs. Thank you for informing us <:frogheart:874349470316371988> ."
i did all the steps including the code in description and after i re-react it gives me error please help me fix it,"hello ur realm eye graveyard is still hidden, that’s why there’s an error. try redoing it and refreshing the page a couple times and them go thru verification again:)) if that still doesn’t work for you, you’re free to contact any security"
Had  a blast in Superbimp's karaoke runs pretty funny guy,"Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed his runs. I'll be sure to pass your kind words on."
so this ARL yanibenim unmuted a guy called antez in the lounge and that guy basically started screaming and earraping everyone in the lounge idk if its not allowed to do that but it was very ignorant to do such a thing,"We are very sorry to hear that. This will be investigated and the appropriate action taken - thank you for informing us of the incident. If there is anything else you would like to add, please send it across in another message."
"I was in a nest chain run by Cutepid tonight and a player by the name of ""Messi"" was harassing the RL the whole run, saying lots of gross sexual comments and also being blatantly transphobic and sexist. It made me and many others in the run uncomfortable.  I understand it is the internet and you cant control what people say but it really ruins the run when people like that are in it. Please let me know if you need any information :3","Alright thanks for letting us know, I'll look into it. Hope it doesn't happen again"
lf manual verification,You'll have to appeal your verification denial in osanc before you can verify here. Contact one of the staff there.

Can I get refunded on tickets? I was in a run where the key kicked the rl and trl and security and then everyone else left :p,"We will give you your refund of points shortly, apologies for the inconvenience."
Hello I have lost 25 points due to a troller called mimi how do i get it back,"I have given you a refund of your points, sorry that this happened"
i just recovered my old account on discord and need help with verififcation,Glad to hear it! Get in touch with any security and we can work out the details.
"Hello, I have some concerns regarding the requirements for advanced runs. As a rogue enjoyer, I find it very difficult to meet the reqs. You need 4 points total and it is frankly too difficult for me to reach. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of things I shouldn't be, as I am highly capable of doing nests and cults and voids but not o3 yet. Please take what I say into consideration, thank you.","Hey, sorry you feel this way. Our advanced reqs are made based off of damage and rogue by default just doesn't do as much as most characters. On the sheet however we do have avarice at 3 points which is very generous as well as monocle which for rogue which gives you already half of the required points. Hopefully this helped."
snake unmuting me and disconnecting me from lounge,"Hello, can you elaborate a little bit? Did snake do that out of nowhere? We trust our staff, so I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation. ty :))"
Koolfizz is having a channel open for much longer than 30 minutes. I have been told this is not allowed.,"Hey there, you're correct as channels cannot be open for longer than 30 minutes in a chain. However, our timestamps show the channel being created for a total of 34 minutes before being deleted. Taking into account the time of the afk check and calling location, the channel was open for almost exactly 30 minutes"
"Hi, I don't know why I am blacklisted but I am returning player from few years ago. Can I rejoin?",Absolutely - please contact any security and we'll sort this out.
I don't have a clip of it. It was someone in Snake's irl surroundings that could be heard through VC.,"Okay, thank you so much for your time. We will try to see whats going on. Just keep in mind, everyone isn't always going to have the best mic with the best noise suppression so just bare with him for the time being:)) enjoy your day/night"
There was a background person in Snake's run who would persistently make sexual and distracting comments in the Nest chain,"Hello, we apologize for the experience. We'll take a look at it and notify HRLs. Can you elaborate, did Snake unmute someone or was it just in Snake's irl surroundings? Also, did you happen to clip it?"
This guy cutepid puts up a headcount gets all the reacts and decides to join another RL's raid instead right after.,"Hey, a headcount is just a gauge to see how a potential raid can preform. No rl is obligated to put up a run after a headcount. Sorry about that!"
"randomly moaning instead of calling loc, singing in the middle of the run and generally acting like he snorted 3 adderall >.>",LOL sorry for the inconvenience ;-; do u happen to have a clip or anything?
Yo vet verify in LH doesnt work https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/347885015964712970/1101246387573768202,"Hey mate, ill give it to you now."
"Hey mods, I'm having trouble figuring out how to get cult/void/halls tags to my account for call outs. I thought this was a bot command but am not sure. Is this still the case or do I need to talk to someone for this? Thanks!",Hey if you just head over to the channel named <#787200146357354528> under the raiding section you can select which roles you'll be given by the bot to get pings for. Hope this helps.
Blip in adv void failed a void by not instructing people to clear minions. it was horrible.,"Alright thanks, we will notify the HRL team"
"Hello, what is wrong with cutepid? This person was making whole raid very uncomfortable with its voice and also calling us sweeties and so much more, it was telling us some story and it wasnt leading at all, at the end of the raid it left","Thanks for letting us know, we will notify the HRL team and hopefully change his attitude"
"I'm quite new to the discord side of rotmg. I'm a old player that used to play many years ago and recently returned. I'm trying to get my head around the gear requirements since I don't really know the items, my current question is if my current hide is allowed or if it gives me -1 point since its ST and I have no idea what rule applies to the ST's apart from whole sets?","Hey there, if you're talking about the advanced req sheet there are items that have corresponding points when used. If you do not see the item you want to bring on the sheet then that means that it doesn't meet the reqs and can only be used with the full ST set."
this mf MukuroGod has quietest fucking mic i swear. Missed a 4 chain just now and earlier this week I almost missed other runs by him,"Hey there, sorry to hear about this incident. "
"RL tecla was very friendly and told entertaining stories, runs were so clean i didnt need to touch any hp pots for the entirety of the 5 chain which is impressive because im bad at dodging","Glad to hear it, I'll let the HRLs know"
sooodaa missed spooky call as he was too busy trying to get everyone to say boo,"This is most unfortunate, he must've been scared by spooky boi! I'll let the HRLs know"
hi,"Hello, this is modmail. How can we help?"

(from school).,It's fine just try not to do it again lol and have a good day (from home)
Shoutout to Superbimp for being a good RL 🙂,Nice to hear this positive feedback! This will be passed on.
"Hey man, my favorite rl during the whole event was Husky. He was so friendly and professional when it comes to leading. He truly helped me get the grind done when it comes to exalting. Whithout Huskys leading I dont think I would have been able to grind 10 hours every day during the event, so I think Adris team should be the one winning this conets","Hey there, I'm glad to hear you loved Husky's raids, I'll make sure your kind words get passed on."
Is using mistake gear as swapout allowed?,"Nope, see <#379504881213374475>"
iamrlycool is rly cool,"Thanks, we will him and hrls know"
I would haver leveles up and I draged cru away from group,You must be 2/8 in attack and dex as well. You were severely Underreqs and you were level 3. Make sure to check out <#379504881213374475> for future runs!
"Ah that worked, thank you!",anytime :))
"Hello, I haven't played in a few years, remembered this discord existed, and was hoping to participate in some runs. I just found out I'm blacklisted, though I'm not sure why? I don't recall having ever broken any rules.","Hi there, yes you didn't break any rules :)) It's only because you were denied verification by previous staff. Please try verifying again, let us know if you have any more questions"
Hello i was trying to verify for pubhalls and it said someone is already verified as me is which ik because it was my old discord witch i got locked out of is their anyway i can verify this one instead,Yop just contact any online security and they'll happily help you out :)

"I want to get verified at lh server, my account is old cuz i used to play at old computer and most of the times i used to be trading other than playing, now i got a better pc that can run rotmg exalt and i play when i can, but i really want to join a lost halls discord server to get better loot with less time, but when i tried to confirm just was told me to play along 2 weeks to just find i was blacklisted somehow",If you wish to appeal you'll have to contact `214196145121918976` aka Reststop.
"mod mail Xenen MuhaiGami and Ickool as thanks for not only allowing me to crash the run, dragging me into vc, and letting me make as many errors I made at 3am my time. Just a thank you for being so lenient, I know its part of the rules that I may get suspended for saying this.",Kk thnx for letting us know
"My Discord account got terminated a while back. I need to verify under the name ""Crucify"" on this Discord.","You can dm any security online (displayed on the right side of the server), and send them a screenshot of you in your vault. Make sure you explain to them that you want to swap discord accounts"
could i please get unbanned from this server? Me and a VRL had a disagreement and we were both in the wrong. thank you.,You have been reverified
appeal,You are through to the moderation team. What would you like to say?
"Was in VC in mbc, in early void my discord crashed. I cant just alt tab in middle, i would die but okay",Thank you for clarifying. Your warning has been removed.
Makes up to just 101 voids,You're vet verified now!
Makes up just over 100,Hey there! Were you trying to send multiple images? We only received one of them (the rogue showing 54 voids)
"This is fucking bullshit I have been in this server 3 years never did anyting wrong never was warning or suspended and i get suspended now in the lost halls event for being ""under reqs' not even without a wariing.  This is ridiculus, i am a fucking human being and i can make a fucking mistake like every one i except to be warned first because i fucking chose the wrong char by accident and didnt realize. I have 100 fucking necros. You need to get ur mods straight fucking childs having a lil bit of power and abusing it. Absurd","If you would like to appeal your suspension, dm `@Drot | Kuvu#6270` on discord as he's the one who suspended you"
how about the location,If it didn't give you early loc then im guessing it doesn't give it for fungals.
"Pls chat back, just chatted wrong channel, mb","Nothing much to chat about, the warning and mute explain it pretty well."
"it was a 2 chain fungal. RL forgot to call 75% in the first crystal cavern. In the chat, raiders were telling him to call it but apparently he doesnt check chat. Once he realized that he forgot to call 75%, he spent the whole boss encounter apologizing to the people who didnt make it, and made 0 calls.","Hey there, thanks for letting us know I'm sorry to hear about this experience. May I know the Rl's Name? Also if you have any footage of this incident would be greatly appreciated."
"So I was in lounge and I reacted fungal tome for a run. I got in the run's vc but the bot didn't give me the location and points, though I did confirm my fungal with the bot","Hey man, you dont get points for fungal."
hello it told me that if i didnt get verified in 48 i can contact a stafff and i have been waiting for 3 days now can someone verify me and thank you,"Hey mate, contact any online security for assistance."
"This is an error because I had joined once, then stopped playing and after a while came back and now I can't verify, as it is already verified",Hello there - please contact any online security for help with this 🙂
i got new discord account,"Hey mate, contact any online Security for assistance."
I was randomly just designated to be kicked from a void ran by symphany for no reason. I was an 8/8 paladin with no banned items and enough points.,"Seems like a mistake on our part, we apologize for the inconvenience"
I have not been using any swapouts at the time,Well I'm sorry that happened then. We'll make sure that an HRL speaks to SuperXDuty about following the reqs sheet that he posted.
Here is the screenshot of the set at the time,Were you using any swapouts?
"Items in red boxes have been used at the time, according to a rating of 3/4, which satisfied the requirements of the run. However, this has proven untrue, leading me to believe the actual requirements are different and therefore the referenced sheet is misleading raiders.",Do you have a screenshot of the set you were using? Those 3 items would be acceptable in a 3/4 run but without knowing what set you had on there is not much we can do.
"SuperXDuty has pointed at an incorrect reqs sheet for a run, then proceeded to kick for following the sheet","Hey there, could you please direct us to which req sheet he was referring to? Any additional info would be very helpful!"
GrantSB and his excessive talking in RSA,Appreciate you letting us know about this. I went ahead and looked at what Grant has been typing and I can't say he was spamming or flooding it with unimportant info.
.,everything okay?
Why and how did I get blacklisted? What did I do wrong before even entering this discord?,hey man u were denied by previous staff when you tried to verify years ago. just contact any security and they can help u with that :p
can i have my tickets back i didnt make it into run,"Hey there! Your points were refunded, sorry to hear you were unable to make it into the run!"
"Mod Mail: Superbimp is a great singer. I loved their rendition of That's what makes you beautiful, but I was a little disappointed that he didn't do ALL of the voices. Overall great runs and I had the most fun doing boring nests in a while","Great to hear, thanks"
"Give my man Superbimp his singing role, runs are actually more fun that way","Cool, will consider"
"Hello, would it be possible to get verified? I can't access my old account so I started a new one when I got back into the game, and I was told by the other mod to wait a few days. It's been a few days, and I think my vault shows that I have been active on this account 😅","Hey there, contact any online security for assistance."
it's not my fault you have like 1 void run in 2 hours and 80 people wanting to join,"Hey there, there have been multiple runs going on and we also have the ticket feature aswell as other React Priority Drag/Early Location So maybe Bring one of those to avoid any Punishments from Crashing."
yo why am i blacklisted i meet the reqs no?,"Hey there, Feel free to reach out to any online security for assistance."
for an advanced kogbold run by Reactionist he called the server once without any warning and i missed the run as a result. he may have been a bit flustered since the key apparently was not showing up until the last second but he still should have at least given warning that he was about to call server,"Thanks for letting us know, I'll forward this to the HRL team."
"Ah! Forgot that was a thing entirely, thank you, great rest of your day, (great support btw)","Hope you have a lovely day, I'll be closing this ticket now. "
"Yeah sorry 1 last one, how do I get into contact with him, if he doesn't accept my friend request to dm?","u can prob just dm them wo having to be friends :)) just click on them, 3 dots, then message"
"Okay thank you for the help with that info, have a lovely day.","yea ofc, let us know if u have any more questions :)) and u too"
"Enmei is their ign, I believe they are just 1 of many ppl struggling to verify recently, but after doing everything I did to get verified, I think there must've been an error","ok so their verification was denied, you need to contact <@344541015971069954> to appeal it"
"Hey, I have a concern I need to discuss, a friend of mine is trying to get verified with the server, but they're under manual review, is there anyway to know if something can be done?","hi, ofc we can help you figure this out :)) whos the ign ?"
"i  have a battle for the nexus key im buying, can i pop it for the discord and have a rl host it?",Feel free to drop it in <#943879720066498580> and if an RL is willing to lead it then youll get your run 🙂

"Cheggles had a rather iffy run, I think it should be enforced that if an RL doesnt feel good they should stay away from RLing, poor callouts on second chain in terms of being consistent with him going without callouts for 30-40 seconds at a time",We're sorry to hear that. We'll make sure to let an HRL know so that something can be said to him.
How do we get any of the Boi Roles,"Go to <#787200146357354528>, rest is very intuitional."

superbimp's kareoke runs slap harder than will smith. get this guy the kareoke leader role,"LOL tysm for the kind words, we'll forward this to him as well as the HRLs :))"
mod mail Superbimp's runs are really fun and karaoke is a great twist on what's normally a focused group.,Glad to hear it! This has been passed on 🙂
"mod mail I want to report superbimp for not calling correctly as well as singing karaoke, the whole time, and I could not also deaf in myself, so I had to listen to Him singing, which broke my concentration from the cringe and it resulted in my character dying. I asked him to make calls like normal RL, and he responded with that he wasn’t even an RL. He was just an exalted player or something. I usually don’t like to report mod mail, but he was not leading the dungeon correctly, and I’m not very good at doing , Steamworks. he also responded with if you dont like it then you can leave, i know that is true  but i like this server and doing runs on it and its discouraging for me to support the server when there are RLs like that dont do the bare minimum","Alright, we will talk to him about it. Thanks for letting us know about him not giving calls up to standards, also we are sorry for your death."
"Hey, there was  a warning applied to my account. I was warned with not posting sniffer logs in raid chat. Where can I post them? If I cannot, please update your rules and not make up new ones or if they have already been established, let the raiders know.","Hey there, its Under <#482368517568462868> "

I have not removed a RL from any runs in any keys that I have popped. I think I am mistaken with a different key popper,"Indeed, it appears you are correct. Many apologies for this - your warning has been removed."
"Very cool and chill RL.  We unknowingly lost our fungal and RL ended up having to nexus when crossing the void river, BUT he still made appropriate RL calls with like 99% accuracy LOL.  I'm guessing someone messaged him for the shotgun phase because he even did his best in counting them for us.  I like to think a great RL can give effective calls like this during void without even being in the run 🙂 Great RL!",hey thanks for the positive feedback !! we'll let him know hes doing a great job and it'll be forwarded to HRLs :))
I havent played in along time dont have access to old discord because 2fa lockout,Feel free to dm any online security
pls continue with the kareoke runs! those were amazing and is really a nice way to spend time,"We appreciate your enthusiasm for the Karaoke runs hosted by Superbimp! These runs are not a standard in the server, however they are certainly appreciated from Superbimp. He will host these runs when he is available to do so as life may have other plans from leading exalts. Thank you for your patience and have a lovely event!"
"Drew in both raiders and keys, and resulted in runs which not only were successful at completing exalts, but also very enjoyable to participate in. I (along with others, I'm sure) would love that more runs like this be made possible by both Superbimp and other organizers as well.","Hello and thank you for contacting modmail today about our exalt leader Superbimp!! We are pleased to hear the exalt runs were not only successful yet they were pleasing to everyone’s ears and made running exalts less tedious. We will relay your positive feedback to the HRLs, have a wonderful event king."
"Superbimp was a nice RL, good vibes, made exalt runs really enjoyable ❤️","Hello! Thank you for contacting modmail today to share Superbimp’s success as an exalt leader here! We will share your positive feedback with the HRLs to relay towards Superbimp, have a wonderful rest of your event king."
"Superbimp had some awesome karaoke runs, we want more of these + karaoke bot holy shiiiit","Hello! Thank you for reaching out to modmail to let us know about those rifftastic karaokes!! We will inform the HRLs of his massive success with these special runs, have a wonderful rest of your event! ❤️"
the karaoke nests are super fun,Glad you enjoyed them! This feedback will be passed on 🙂
superbimp's runs are amazing don't ban him we love him anyone who doesn't is free not to join. also can i get a list for 4/4 on all classes some rls told me they would ask and send one but never got a message back,"Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed the runs! Your kind words have been passed on."
Hey its my first modmail and surprisingly positive one i just wanted to say that superbimp karaoke raids are so entertaining  and point that he is doing something more than others for lost halls community to make it better place for all people 😄,"Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed the runs! Your kind words have been passed on."
as a raider i fully support SuperBimb karaoke runs,"Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed the runs! Your kind words have been passed on."
"Keep Superbimp and his kareoke runs, makes for a fun time","Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed the runs! Your kind words have been passed on."
"however as the rules state, ALL OF these sorts of activities are considered leeching therefore your opinion is invalidated again, please either change these rules by enforcing them to all of the mentioned dungeons else remove my warning because of the frequent occurrence.","The rules do not state the purposely not going into an o3 (which we do not host here) or a Crystal cavern are leeching. Because they aren't. You are purposely instructed by the RL in a Crystal and an o3 to not go in unless you are going to help clear. Maybe you just misunderstand the meaning of the word ""leech""."
"but that is still considered leeching if people were to stay outside of a fungal cavern, what you fail to understand this broad topic of afk/leeching is just total bs, now i want the appeal removed or its actually an unjust situation of truly what is now considered leeching and that many players WILL stay outside of a cult, fungal, o3, even shatters.",What you fail to understand is that not going into a fungal or o3 during the clear is a strategy so as to not hp scale enemies health to make killing the enemies faster. This is not the case for a cult or shatters because with 40+ people already in the dungeon the increased hp scaling of 1 person is negligible. These are 2 completely different situations and your comparing this is a false equivalence.
"hi, id like my warning appealed, this is the same scenario as waiting outside of crystal cavern, oryx sanctuary, shatters, and likely other dungeons that are similar.","From what you described, these scenarios do not seem similar. Staying outside of a Crystal cavern speeds up the clear because of less up scaling. And even then you’re still required to enter at 75% so that you are there for the whole boss fight. Your description of events makes it seem like you afked outside of the Cultist’s hideout until the boss was doing his final 5 shots guns and only then did you go in. Missing out on an entire boss fight and not only entering during loot phase does sound like a textbook case of leeching. In any case though, it was just a warning, and not a suspension. As long as you do not make this mistake again, no further punishments will come to you. Have a good day."
"Mod mail for Superbimp: excellent leader, very fun and good calls. Good community engagement as well.","Hey there, glad to hear you enjoyed the runs! Your kind words have been passed on."
"Hello, positive mod mailing about superbimp's raids. He got nice calls and his runs are funny aswell. Nice RL","Hey there, glad to hear you're enjoying his runs. Your kind words will be passed on."
"Karaoke runs are fun, would be nice to have a discord bot for music.","Hello! We are glad to hear you are enjoying the karaoke runs, the HRLs will know of this feedback! ❤️ Once upon time there used to be a music bot, it was ultimately removed since people couldn’t be trusted with it anymore for abusing the music with inappropriate audios."
i have a problem with verififcation,"Hey, if you're still having issues reach out to any online Security for assistance!"
oryxpumper is abusing his power,"Hey there, Could you please give a little more info on what happened?"

the RL delerium kept singing during the lh... first at mbc (didnt call out keys cause he was singing) and then at void (didnt call medium boys or big boys at all during the copies phase cause he was too busy singing/laughing) he was just micspamming the whole run with little to no actual helpful callouts,Sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience with Delerium. This feedback will be passed onto the HRLs.
Delerium had the best most epic void runs very cool 10/10,Glad you enjoyed Delerium’s runs! This feedback will be passed on.
"is there a way to get those supporter reacts reset? because i literally cant join runs without it due to australian ping, so thats 2 runs i missed out on in my 10 daily limit","Hey man, sorry to hear about your reacts going to waste, I gave you 60 points that you can use to get early drag into VC, hope that helps!"
"3 void runs in a row by Fattywww where there's been 60+ in bazaar, all on the same server. I've wasted 2 supporter reacts because of this.","Sorry about this, I will let the HRL team know. Thank you for the feedback."
hello i would like to appeal my blacklist status,Reach out to any online security for assistance.
"I want to send a negative comment regarding a behavior in a void run by RL Spooky, he was not the person who was leading the run, but he was talking continuously with the person leading Mrgalatis. The situation arose in the last part of void, when Spooky started to say that there was a Knight using a break armor shield, he said it in a burlesque way and as something stupid (let's keep in mind that it is not in any way mandatory to have to use a stun shield or another) at the end of the run when we were collecting the loot, after Spooky looked at my set he started telling the leader look it's Tossak who uses the break armor HA HA HA HA. I felt that it is not an attitude typical of a person who has a higher rank than any player, I consider it bullying and somewhat unfriendly.",We’re sorry to hear that you had this experience. We’ll past this onto the HRLs so this behavior can be dealt with.
"pierce is absolutely awesome. He is funny, kind, and very sympathetic. I want to give him some good feedback, I enjoy him.",Glad to hear it. We’ll pass this great feedback onto the hrls
Mrgalatis allows 32 people into his fullskip voids before the channel opens. I have been trying for an hour and cant get into a single one of his runs. This ruins the enjoyment and the fairness for the rest of us. He is also unfriendly when I mention this to him. 0 star review.,"We're sorry you're having this experience. There are many, many people early reacting to afk checks during the event. We are sorry he has a bad attitude and something will be said to him. Thank you."
Hello,"Hey there, did you need any help with anything?"
"modmail: Fatty did god's work with those fullskips, very under appreciated",Woah that's crazy man! Modmail denied <:pusbal:982329382410530816>
have a concern,Hello - what would you like to say?
why is my account blacklisted? what is the problem,"Hey there! It looks like you were blacklisted for any potential suspicion of trying to verify as an alt account.

"Nacnudd, great Rl.","That is wonderful to hear, is there anything about Nacnudd you found extraordinary compared to other runs? Ex: The quality of leading provided, good personality, or map reading is flawless?"
"fattywww hard carrying event right now with lots of super clean runs, very much appreciated","Hey there! Glad to hear you are having a pleasant event with Fattywww, is there anything in particular in his raids that make them super clean? Ex: Quality of calls, good personality, or excellent map readings?"
Fattywww continuing to use a loc that had 36 people in bazaar before he even called the loc causing me to lose a supporter use because why the fuck would u still use that loc,I'm so sorry you had this experience. The hrl's will make sure to fix this problem and I will personally give you 40 points so you can use it to make the next fullskip void.
Is fatty…fullskipping voids then leaving when they get to mbc and unmuting a raider? And then starting another fs? Seems kinda genius but like the fuck?,Based ffwoggggy modmail. Yes that does appear to be the case and it will be dealt with. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. -Grizzell
"https://imgur.com/hPa990n rl Fattywww has 2 voice channels up (cloned) with the exact same name at the exact same time. Both were locked before the channel opening for the run and had the same number of members. I clicked on the wrong channel upon opening (it was purely guesswork as to which one was actually the real run). Since all vcs fill up instantly, you can't just wait to see which one has the unlocked icon, you just have to spam click to connect. If you wait for the unlocked icon, you just miss anyway since that's way too slow. Many people missed the run because it was literally a 50/50 to which vc was the correct one to join.",Hey there. We're very sorry for the inconvenience. Something has already been said to Fattywww about this behavior and it should not happen again. We appreciate you letting us know!
this fattywww guy just popped the key full of crashera didnt even gave time to get pots or anything lol,"Once the number of people in bazaar is equal to the number of people in vc, the RL typically tells the key popper to pop. Also, the bot that is used for runs has been making opening the channel for Fullskips difficult today. We're sorry you had a negative experience and this will be passed onto the HRLs so that they can talk to the RL about this."
proxtream is super nice rl (:,Glad to hear it. We'll let an HRL know.
"Oryxpumper's runs are very clean, fast, and efficient. I also think that it's great that he enforces the rules that are in the server. I will admit, I tried to break the rules once and he rightly caught and warned me for doing so. However, I have heard him judging players for not bringing certain classes to regular runs and I personally don't think that anybody appreciates being called out that way. Many times I join his runs I find that he is talking down on raiders unnecessarily, and it would be appreciated if that could be toned down, ideally just not happening.",Thanks for the feedback. We'll make sure an HRL knows so they can correct his behavior
"Rammeke is a good raid leader that never misses the important calls in the dungeons that we run together. I appreciate that he leads runs frequently and how clean they are. However, it seems that he is often in a bad mood and is very snappy to the raiders. Personally, this makes me not want to join his runs even though they are frequent and clean.",Thank you for your honest and unbiased comments Scarf. We will pass this feedback onto the HRLs.

"RLs abusing power, 53/50 raid",Where is the power abuse in that? Raiders can get moved in from lounge by reacting to many icons on the afk check as well as RLs are allowed to join raids too. There might be no fault of the RL that there are many people.

Good Evening Mod. I just checked my stats and I haven’t been given points for the 2 fungal keys I opened the other night for strasz or however you spell his name.

yes it was a swap but i used the fungle during that raid before i DC,"sorry about the trouble, if you'd like to appeal the warning you can contact <@443596466401968128>popslave. However, it's just a warning and as long as you don't do it again, you should be fine 👍"

i don't know why im receiving this warning i know the recs for an advanced run i was a priest and i need 5 points i had a fungle tomb witch is worth 5 points iv been raiding in this discord for years and the fact that you would report me and not even know that i did meet recs says alot about you.,"Hey, maybe you accidentally didn't have the fungal equipped as there was a screen shot in game of you having a prot on and your realmeye right now says that character was last seen with a prot on instead of a fungal. Although swapouts are totally understandable, as a fungal you should have that as your main tome 24/7 and there is no need for you to go on prot."
I believe I was issued a warning by mistake by not meeting reqs when I got kicked from a run because I have a different skin of an item I have screenshots I can share as well,"Hey, your warn has been removed and it was simply a mistake on our end. We apologize for this and it won't happen again."
hey i lost my access to my other discord account so now im trying to verify this one i can send a screenshot of my vault in game with my discord tag to prove it. Thats how I got verified on oryx sanctuary,hi pls contact any on security and they can help u out there :))

you guys should add laser pointer to reqs though it's higher dps than dusky without the silence debuff,We will almost definitely be adding it just hasn't happened yet. Until then technically if it's not on the sheet it's not allowed but the person kicking you should really ask if you have a swappout wand.
got kicked from an advanced run with this set \,"hiya, are you sure you were kicked because of your set?"
nope no clips sorry,ok have a nice day
"someones gotta teach straszman basic map reading rules, he didnt know that a two split was main path and ran all the way back just to hit his 2nd pot while insisting that the two split could not have been main path, also super late calls, like telling us to push above the tentacle after its already all the way out","Hi, we apologize for the bad experience. Would you happen to have any clips of this? If not, it's okay. This will be forwarded to the HRLs. Cheers"
"I'm sending a modmail to OryxPumper. In most if not all of his runs, he was insensitive to the raiders, telling people to ""stop being pussies and push in"" and if they didn't he'd pm key and kick them. He also decides to just ""not do calls because he's not fucked"" which I find extremely toxic as new players are wanting to learn dungeons in his runs and he's denying them of that. Overall, a very rude and insensitive person.",We're sorry to hear that. We will be sure to let the HRLs know so that this behavior can be fixed.

The fungal run was lead by a newly promoted EL and they accidentally put up 2 afk's, that's why it closed. Sorry for the misunderstanding ! I will remove your warning asap :))"
"I just got kick from a dungeon by KeyPopSlave for running the easter knight set.

Hi  I tried to connect to your discord server but I got denied. Is there a way to connect to the server? Thank you in advance for your reply.,"you were denied by <@727238620809003178> , so please dm them to appeal tyvm"
how can i connect them ? 😦,"If you're asking to transfer your rotmg acc to a new discord acc in the server, you can go ahead and dm any online security. If you're talking about losing your rotmg acc, you'll have to ask rotmg themselves to help you get your acc."

"Hello, I have recently been doing quite a few voids almost every night for the past few weeks. I just wanted to give my thanks to a few RL's that have been doing a great job and providing great night time runs. These rl's would be Xenen, AladdinMan, Marshall, Ches, Ickool, Nacnudd, FishtheCat and Delerium. These guys all have good call outs, positive energy, and make entertaining runs that ive been very happy to pop keys for. They all deserve a gold stars and the ARL's mentioned should really be considered for a promotion, imo. Thanks for reading.","Tysm for your feedback lovely raider, we will pass this one to the head of the raid leaders"

OryxPumper is a great RL. At this point he has shown he is well versed and understands Halls at the level of a Raid Leader. I believe he should be promoted to RL. Thanks for your time.,Thanks for the great feedback. We’ll make sure to let an HRL know
"Honestly, Tubs is the most valuable staff isn't he. Oh my days the man himself is funny af. Best officer  throughout the raiding discord universe!",We all love Tubs dearly
Having issues verifying since my realmeye graveyard isn't updating. IGN is Cryophoenix,"Hey Boss, Reach out to any Online security for assistance."
"I usually join raids from my phone because it is faster to join. My phone ran out of batteries during a Cult (April 10th, 2023 9:59pm EST) and before I could rejoin on desktop, `;ZDalja` had me parsed. Not sure if the key popper `>KeyPopSlave` parsed of his own volition either, since he parsed numerous people during this run by himself, then stated in chat that they ""dragged on him"" when the group clearly stuck together. Even if someone had accidentally or purposefully peaked, it does not seem fair to immediately parse without warning.","Hiya, when parsing, it should be immediate to catch crashers as quick as we can for a smooth and efficient run for everyone and therefore doesn’t require a warning prior. However, you were definitely in the vc and could have rejoined, so we’re sorry for the inconvenience as it is a bit unfair. We can let him know to pm people who can rejoin for future reference. Also, dragging is suspend worthy and it’s up to the RL to issue punishment. ty and happy raiding :3"
How would i claim Verified Key Popper just popped 18 total keys,Looks like you already have the role!
Allow OryxPumper's Sorc / Sseal runs (allow OryxPumper to drag in sorcs into vc before opening channel),Inshallah
Are these any keys or just LG,"They are for any keys popped. Only exception is for modded key popper role, which is any modded key"
How many keys to pop for Keypoppper,"15 for verified key popper, 50 for veteran key popper, 100 modded key pops for modded key popper role"

he made efficient calls with great timing,Thank you for the positive feedback! I will pass this onto the HRL team.
dayqpi lead very well !!!,Thats great to hear! Was there anything in particular that you enjoyed about the run?
but bot not dragged me x(,"Discord bots cannot put you in a voice channel, they can only remove or move you so you must join lounge to be moved into the correct vc before you react. I would recommend continuing to join the vc manually even if you do react."
from this raid,"You were removed from the raid because you were not in the vc, aka crashing"
hi Tubs is handsome and has a great music taste. lots of love from Brazil,"We're glad to hear you had a positive experience with Tubs, your feedback is appreciated and will be forwarded directly to Tubs, he will be flattered~"
Hello was hoping for some clarity as to why I was denied I messaged blib a few days ago with no response,"Hey, we have let him know and he will get back to you as soon as he has time."
The bot wont verify my account and i dont know why,Hi there - contact any online security and we'll be happy to help 🙂
"What's good mods, this arl that goes by OryxPumper doesnt even play with ingame chat on, he kept yelling at our one trickster to decoy when everyone in chat told him it was a upe and that he didnt react with trickster to the run, and then after that oryxpumper went and died to a pop rock 😐 on a knight 😐",Alright thank you we will pass this on to the hrl's. Sorry to hear about that.
i would like to know why i was blacklisted and how to get unblacklisted,Contact any online security :)

"Hi, copy and pasting my message in general because I sent before I saw we could ask questions here. hi, didnt see in faqs so ill ask here. is this the right place for someone looking to learn LH or just for ppl who already know it pretty well.

"Yeah it was, I was first pop out of a 3 chain","Aight, the key sshould be logged now"
And this was the first,"Alright i'll deal with that, was it just one key?"
I popped a Davy yesterday with Best and he didnt log it because bot was broken and I havent gotten credit since bot has been back up,"Make sure you let the rl know about that, if he doesnt answer message any security to get that pop logged 🙂"

"I've been trying to join the Lost Halls server but have apparently been blacklisted by someone who isnt staff anymore. I'm not sure why this is, but I may have joined a long time ago as a noob and done something stupid like joining a run without meeting reqs... Im not too sure. Could I please have this blacklist re-evaluated and appealed? Even if i can't get off the blacklist, can I be told the reason why?","Hi, dm and online security and we can sort this out for you 🙂"

tubs rizz school shatters were great!,Thank you for your feedback - this will be passed on!
didn't post in vc? I posted in loot oofs? also where is the rule against sniffer???,"Sniffers aren't allowed, we did post it in announcement which is harder to see (https://discord.com/channels/343704644712923138/433117430588375040/1054868028875083856) which is why you were only warned, no punishment was handed out."
doesent mean that i cant crash more ;)))))),"By all means, but just so you know crashing while suspended can lead to a 2 week suspension and even a perma suspend!"
"ok, this is my only account, i tried logging in with a different one because i was having trouble logging in. this won't happen again","no worries, just DM any person with the role '**security**' for assistance on the blacklist"

change name,"Hey mate, make sure your name history is public on realmeye then head over to <#347885015964712970> and run the command `;cn <new name>`"

my old discord mairo got locked because i lost acces to the auth of my discord so now im trying to get verified on this discord acount with the same rotmg account,"Hey mate, DM any online security for help with that."
"I got kicked from a dungeon after using points to get the location because i was not in voice chat, is there a way to get my points back? I looked through rules and raid stuff and it doesn't say i have to be in the voice chat, plus the discord does not allow me to join one when the countdown stage is there","Unfortunately you won't be able to get your points back. You're required to be in vc in any raid, even if you used points. Points give you 'Early Location' the reason why you weren't able to join the vc is most likely due to the raid already starting. Just ask the RL to move you in from 'Lounge' voice channel. Otherwise it would be considered crashing."
hey how do i get location without using a key? i see most people know where to go but it fails me in the afk check or something everytime,"To get early location without a key, when there’s a run up looking for reacts in raid status announcement, clicking on the reacts (like fungal or mseals)  will give you the location.

"Hello, says i am blacklisted from this server but i am unsure why. I took time of realm for over a year and deleted all of the servers but i never did anything against code.",hey there! dm one currently online security. cheers.
Are there any resources where people can teach me how to map read LH's and learn how to call phases? What would y'all recommend?,"Hey there! If you're looking to learn map reading you can check <#708377123387080704> under the Info section and join our Lost Halls Classroom. You can ping for a map reading lesson in there. In terms of learning the calls, the easiest way would be to just sit in on some runs and pay attention to what our RLs say. If you have more questions about getting TRL or EL feel free to message Sxcial#3019 on discord."
I told Delerium I'm having a good time but I wanted to do my first modmail anyway xd,"Sorry to hear about that experience, this will be passed on to the HRL team and the appropriate action will be taken."

"on russian language its said be like "" Ошибка взаимодействия "" something like this","Understood, thank you for the information.

i cant beleived i got warninged for being under req,Hey man! Just meet reqs next time 😄
aint no way bruh,"hi, this is modmail :)) did something happen?"
How to unblacklist? I am unsure what I did,contact any security that's currently online. cheers!
this is suspendable seriously? my computer crashed during mbc,"You weren't crashing, you were not 8/8 and all I can see is 7/8 not how far you are from 8/8 so as that is under reqs you were kicked and suspended."
"he is just a cool guy, chill. helpful in my last void, very fast mbd.",TYTY will tell hrls he's cool
good rl @Réseaux#5614 / Daayn,"Hi thanks for the positive feedback on Daayn, do you mind explaining what makes him a good rl? :)"
my priest is 8/8? this suspension is completely false,It was not 8/8.
Blib abusing powers again... Got suspended for crashing W/O warning. Didn't know i was crashing LH until i was suspended. A whisper to leave the dungeon would have been nice.,"We very rarely pop dungeons outside of a bazaar. If you enter a bazaar and enter the dungeon that is popped, there is a pretty good chance it is a Discord server hosted run. If you go into a dungeon that you were not invited to, there is a good chance you will be kicked. It is not on our staff to tell you that you're crashing."
"Hello, I've recently had time to play realm again, and would like to keep dungeon running as an option when i have more characters maxed, but i'm thinking about changing my ign. If I do this, will there be any complications with verification and such? I didnt see any similar questions anywhere in the FAQ and i also didnt see a questions channel, so forgive me if this is the wrong way of asking questions. That's about it, thanks.","Make your Realmeye name history public and then go to bot-commands, type `;cn (new name)` and the bot will update your name change in the Discord. 🙂"
this is an error,contact any one of the securities that is currently online
"I was in the guild hall, no pally or buffs. No curse or anything. Just auto the 50 def dummy with the staffs","Yes, I was saying perhaps you need to include that in your calculations"
"Terry's runs are the best. He is a super awesome possum. He's poggin, swausin, and bussin. Believe it, I know it.","poggers thx for the feedback, we'll pass it to the HRLs B)"
"I just tested t14 staff, and a bunch of other staffs on 50 def guild dummy. T14 did far less than many UT's. For example S.T.A.F.F. is like over 20% more dmg than t14. Should def be at least 1 point?","We are working on implementing an updated req sheet for advanced, vets and accursed right now so please bare with us as there is a lot we are trying to do now. However the S.T.A.F.F does not do as much as a t14 based on the DPS calc. Maybe your numbers might be off due to pally/war/expose buffs or maybe your pet was applying damage to the dummy on one trial and not on another trial? The S.T.A.F.F is very good though and we are going to be looking into it 🙂"
btw why is curse not prio react? 1 curse is 25% more dmg from entire raid?,"Hey thanks for your question. The reason is because most of the time you will have a curse, much like how we dont give early reaction to warrior buffs either. Furthermore, some bosses like the Void Entity cannot be cursed so there is less of a need to give early to that."
i didnt even know there was vc i saw a rando go into baz and followed him,"Hey there, If you see a group of people in a Bazaar and pop A Dungeon I Highly suggest not going into it to avoid any Punishments because its most likely run by a Discord Server."
FishtheCat calls EUWEST and then changes it to US and tells key to pop early so that many people didn't make it,"sorry to hear don, this feedback will be passed onto the hrls ty"
Hey my suspension has ended can I join the discord again?,"You are unsuspended now, sorry about that but the bot didn't give all of your roles back when unsuspending"
Delerium - 0 callouts 40 politically charged comments. Cannot stand this guy tbh. Negative speech bad for community.,"sorry about the bad experience you had with him, thank you for reaching out to us. Ill pass this onto the HRL's."
"Modmail: Did a series of Cults from 12-1 pm EST with ARL Delerium. During 3 consecutive runs in a chain, Delerium lead a discussion that was inappropriate and offensive.  From objectifying women to acting racist (""Is there anyone black in here? ... I hate BLM"") to demeaning the LGBTQ community (""being gay is a choice"") to saying that ""China has concentration camps"", he made sure he had an insult for every minority.   Again this went on for like 30 minutes until chain concluded, none of this conversation need to happen.  This kid needs to grow up and realize not everyone is a straight white man. I understand that's a lot of the demographic here, but if this community is serious about being inclusive Delerium shouldn't be in a position of power.","Hey, sorry about the bad experience you had with delerium. If you have any recordings or anything of the sort that would be greatly appreciated. This will be passed into the HRL team, thank you for the feedback."
"In the most recent cult chain that Delerium ran, he was oversharing his political views a bit.  He went on about how being gay or trans was a choice, how he would only date white women, how america does not have any systemic racism, and other topics that lead to the discord being a less inclusive community.  I don't mind someone having these views, but those are not appropriate topics for discussion during dungeons.","Hey, sorry about the bad experience you had with delerium. If you have any recordings or anything of the sort that would be greatly appreciated. This will be passed into the HRL team, thank you for the feedback."
Ah okay the feedback is for Terry. Very fun vibes and helped me with my first time tanking through Minefield phase : ),"thank you sm for the positive feedback !! we'll pass this onto the HRL's, have a bless day"
Feedback,"Hey which rl would you like to give feedback on? And for future reference you can just send the feedback to modmail, no need to type “feedback” first."

"I wanna gib pos mail for Terry,  he is a nice tm RL",Can you elaborate what you enjoyed from his runs? We'll pass this onto the HRLs
mod mail,yes very mod-mail. how can we help
hi thank you i dont know who this is but i love you too,"That was ruler, I'm still here too (drot) and I miss you too"
why was i issued a warning for not being in vc when raiding?? i have not done a single halls in this game in weeks,"Hi trillum imy. also there was someone named atumnluv so sec got confused, i take warn away."
Are the requirements different? I haven't seen applications being opened or closed where they usually were; is the function of an EL different?,"Hello Grant, the function is essentially the same, the main difference is that el has no quota. It is a very nice laid back role compared to previous EO, along with it being very involved with raiding because we now do all exalt dungeons other than o3. If you'd like to apply outside of an application wave, just contact and discuss with an HRL. Take care mate."
"(Lost Halls Modmail) Please update the advanced chart sometime soon, including changes from Kogbold and the Item Rework. It may be a little early to know about the Moonlight Village items","this is a great suggestion mate, i'll pass it on cheers"

I have a fully exalted mana on kensei,"Hey, if you're talking about verifying for vet you need 100 completes. If you have proof of 100 completes you can DM any online security and they will be able to give you the role."
"Vast Apathy is so low energy, can barely hear callouts","Best option I have is maybe turn his volume up on your client side? Right click their username and drag the volume bar to the right. As for low energy, staff may unfortunately be starting to burn out from the events. We've led over 3.5k runs over the past week"
why cant i join any vc anymore?,"Everything is fine on our end, must be either discord or something wrong with settings. It might also be a very common discord bug. Feel free to contact any security to help with that in private."
Soooodaa great rl promote now,"Thanks for sharing that, was there anything in particular you liked? Let us know"
my account has been flagged and i am not being verified.,"Hey, you will have to reach out to <@214196145121918976> | `Reststop#1163` to appeal."
"It's difficult to encapsulate exactly why it was offensive, but we were doing a Kogbolds chain and the RL was ... more focused on punishing/suspending people for not meeting reqs than he was on the run. You could hear joy and excitement in his voice every time he had someone kicked. It was just... a gross energy, and a bunch of raiders actually pushed back against him for it. I understand, and I'm sure most/all raiders do, that reqs are important (and not at all difficult to meet). But there is a line. RL's shouldn't be seeking out punishment for punishment's sake, and it should not be the overarching tone of the entire run. I'm sure that we lost 20x as much dps from raiders typing as we did from the people who were under reqs.","Thanks for that information, this will be passed onto our HRL Team."
"I recognize that this is not constructive or conrcetely actionable feedback, but Celoso is such a genuinely unlikeable RL that it needs to be stated. It was annoying and distracting to participate in the raid of such a negative personality and I will personally be avoiding his runs in the future.","Hey there, sorry to hear about the negative experience. Would you be willing to give us some further detail about what exactly happened?"
Hi Terry talks way too much in runs. Sometimes calls out phases of what they are but doesnt say what shots to dodge or where to stand. Just says stay in corners,"Hey sorry for the bad experience, this will be passed onto the HRL's, ty !"
I was unfairly suspended.. I went to the loc that was specified and I think it turned out to be the incorrect loc. I was in vc when the rl told me to trade him but he wasn't at the same loc. I then dm'd him to try and tell him I was at the loc but I don't think he saw it,"according to RL UnluckyPNG, you were also sitting in call ignoring RL when they told you to bring key and held the run, if you would like you could talk it out with him"
They are not accepting DMs.,Ok ill ask him to contact you.
I didn't crash lol im in vc,Contact <@1034191934069166110> if you wish to appeal your suspension.
how would we have known location if we wernt in vc.,"There's multiple ways people can get loc such as someone leaking the loc, or joining when seeing people run towards baz. Simply put this isn't a discussion we should have in Mod-Mail. Any further argument can be directed to my DMs MiniMysteru#0665"
how is the same retard that kicked me going to respond to his own modmail,"Hey there this is Mini, I'm an officer. Being in lounge instead of the run still counts as crashing. We have logs showing that both you and your guild mate were never in the actual raid vc. Long story short, the suspension is warranted. Have a nice day."
"Cringe, showed I was in VC, but I couldnt hear anyone. Explained that to Blib (he ignored it) and I get booted plus warned for crashing when I was sitting in discord.",You couldn't hear anyone because you weren't in vc. If you had the Discord issue where it says you're connected but actually aren't then that's on your end and there's not much we can do. Try finding a way to fix it before joining runs.
I got kicked from dungeon because i DCd from VC. I was sitting in the lounge waiting to be dragged when i was messaged by Blib. He asked why i wasn't in VC and i explained then promptly kicked/warrened please demote this tard.,You were never in the vc for the run meaning you were crashing. We have a channel explaining how to join runs if you head over to `#faq`. This also means you got location from a guild member or friend which is also not allowed. I asked you why you were not in vc and you said you were in lounge which isn't the vc so without any good reasoning and clearly being a crasher you were kicked.
"Tyvm, just wanted to let you know it worked",Glad to hear it!
my ign: Tomquess,Try now.
i dont think it worked. I think im still blacklisted,"Alright, send me your in game name and I'll remove the expel, if that doesn't work DM any security for assistance"

I'm sorry but I really don't see how choosing to not suspend someone from a nest who isn't affecting the dps of the group is encouraging others to reduce the dps in a nest. However I respect this decision though I don't agree. Additionally the reasoning of I don't have a hp ring on is very strange to include. I also don't quite understand the point of appealing a suspension with the person who suspended me. If the suspension truly was completely unjust with the rules (which I am aware this is a bit different) then modmailing is pointless as the original suspender clearly wasn't up for me not being suspended. I only wish to do nests for the limited event and will bring better dps items for such. I understand where I was in the wrong however I just ask that I can peacefully do dungeons with high dps and no worries as I always have. Thanks for listening ❤️,Idk where an hp ring was discussed but what our previous response is saying is that the only person that might unsuspend you is the staff member that originally suspended you so refer to them if you wish to appeal. Rules are rules and everyone including us must always follow them.
"the bot didn't do anything when I re-reacted with the check mark, I'm not sure if i'm doing something wrong or if the bot isn't working","Hi there, that can happen sometimes. Are you trying to verify? If so, contact any online security and we’ll try to sort this out."
Suspended for 2 days from pub halls for bringing an 8/8 warrior with exalts and a stone sword into a default nest. Still out damaging plenty of others in the run. I get that stone sword is banned generally but certainly my already high dps on my class didn't effect the 2 chain nest poorly? Unfair?,"If you'd like to appeal for your suspension, you may contact the person that suspended you (Celoso). In regards to fairness, the rules are set for everyone to follow. If one person is allowed to disregard them, then at that point everyone should be allowed to do so, which then affects the DPS poorly."
who is online security?,"Hey there, It's any of the online staff under the role that says ""Security"""

"So just to clarify, it says for crashing 1-3 day suspension, crashing while suspended is under the 1 week category but says it  you could be banned permanently, and you stated that crashing while already suspended for 1 week is a permanent suspension. So does that mean if I crash on only a 1-3 day suspension I wont get permanently banned just an added week?  Also I'm sorry for being so annoying I just got nervous when I thought I I was at risk of being kicked from the sever, but idk if spamming my inbox with the same message 7 times was really called for.","Hello there mate, sorry for the confusion. I'd say that if you regularly decided to, you would be at risk of being permanently suspended, just because it is quite disruptive. Wouldn't recommend, although that is an interesting exploit. Enjoy your 1 week holiday of no nests, they suck anyway. Take care!"
"I hopped in a random nest from a server I was already in. How was I supposed to know it was a discord run? When I was asked I didn't try to hide anything and openly stated I just hopped in. Are you seriously implying I should no longer go into any keys popped unless I am in a discord voice chat? This is not even a nest server, I checked pest control to make sure I wasn't crashing any runs but they were not running any at the time.",We're not trying to imply anything. You're welcome to go into any dungeon that you want. But you also have to understand that sometimes you might be kicked from those dungeons and warned or suspended if it is a Discord led run.

"-Not sure if this adds on to previous convo. I sent that DarWolf was the best fullskip nest leader. As to the reponse, yes I was joking about the fullskip part, however he did create a great atmopshere in his chain nests last night and I wanted to mention it as it was probably the best atmosphere in a run yet. Great calls as well as interaction and jokes with the raiders. It was an outstanding run and I thought it deserved a mention.","Thank you for clarifying! We will pass this feedback onto the HRLs.

This was my first time in a run with him, but it was fun 😄","Glad to hear you enjoyed Darwolf’s run - we will pass this feedback on to the HRLs 🙂 . However, please could you clarify what you meant by “he didn’t mute me despite me making jokes in chat”? Was it the case that you were somehow unmuted in the VC and he didn’t mute you?

And so i did if you dont want feedback to get your TRL's somewhere then idk man thats on you,Hello Mike. I don’t really understand. All of your three previous modmails providing TRL feedback were responded to and appreciated. Could you describe exactly what the problem is?

Just make sure you ask the rl BEFORE you join the raid and make sure you have a swapout, just in case."
That right there is false cause the reason why he joins the run is not because incase another rl nexuses its because he wants to do the dungeon by limiting the number of rls would put up more runs. Also if you had a VC LESS Channel there would be a ton more runs,"End of the day, one of the perks of being RL is access to runs, we're not taking that away. However, you can join runs early by using tickets, which you can get by bringing essential roles, popping a key, or popping a vial. Going back to what you said a bit ago, contrary to what you said, TRL apps are actually open right now!"
Crazy insta 45 with 3 more rls gone 8 rls 2 runs both insta 45 full,"In case the Rl nexuses the ability for other raid leaders to join in neccesary. I understand that channels filling up quick is a real problem, but limiting the amout of rls in one vc isn't going to change that. In the end if the rl doesn't want to lead a run, he won't, no matter if he can or cannot join fellow leaders run. There are also feedback runs, where there have to be multiple rls in one vc."
Maybe u should make a limit to 2 rls that can join 1 run in reg halls,Can you please elaborate?

I ask to immediately have my suspension removed and I also demand that Celoso/ Gadzstar be retrained for his important role as security as it gives all security a bad name when people like Celoso with fragile egos tarnish their reputation.,"Hello, We understand your frustration as a 3 day suspension would seem unfair for the initial fraction of bringing a T11 katana instead of a T12 Katana, however the raiding rules does mention 1-3 days suspension can change based on severity which in this case meant you did come with a T11 katana and you were not in the voice channel which is considered as crashing with the rules."
"Hi, i was suspended from Lost Halls until 16/03 but i still cant see the raiding channels, like the suspension is still going.","Hello, You should be able to see everything as normal again as the suspension is now lifted. We apologies for the delay however the bot has a known bug for not unsuspending people at the correct time. Our devs are actively investigating the issue, in the meantime if you happen to receive another issue then you are welcome to use modmail again! Thank you and have a nice day 🙏"
yo Moe blacklisted me foreveer ago for no reason can i get unblacklisted pls?,Hiya - DM any online security to sort this out 🙂
am i doing this right?,"Hey there, If you're still having trouble with it feel free to reach out to any Online security for help!"
oh i see. thanks again,all good mate
okay call me corny but my ingame name is lowercase and the bot won't let me change it to lowercase... how do i make it lowercase?,Sorry but if your discord tag is the same as your IGN then your nickname in the server will start with a lower case or higher case depending on your discord tag.
okay thanks!,no worries.
"i changed my name ingame, how do i reflect this change in the servers?/","Make sure you have name history public on realmeye, then go to <#347885015964712970> and use the command `;cn <new name>` if it doesn't work feel free to reach out to any online security."
"Hello Vibot, raid leader ""Erooer"" started a fungal chain and then nexused to crystal cavern. Upon nexusing he closed the entire vc down and left the raiders to fend for themselves even though this was the first key in the chain and the chain continued. Regardless of the skill level of the raiders this is highly irresponsible as he is forcing the group to lose coordination and irresponsibly didn't pass command down to someone who was willing to unmute. This is a highly immature act and to babyrage after nexusing and shutting down the vc is behavior exemplary of a toddler. Evidence attached. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030293164273180734/1086784977632506066/image.png",Thank you for letting us know. We'll make sure to let an HRL know about this so this can be addressed.
“Fiftyballs: didn’t offend me u just a hoe”,We'll make sure to let an HRL know about this. Thank you.
Was trying to apologize to him and this is what he said back to me just thought that was a bit unprofessional of him is all,"Hi, we can't see the message he sent to you. Please try again?"
I am having trouble getting verified,hey there! the only issue was that you did not make everything on your realmeye public. do so and try again with the bot. cheers.
I have been verified before but I do not have access to the server,"Hey, the name you’re trying to verify under already exists within the server. DM any online security and they will be able to help."
why am i in blacklist,You were denied by `Drot | Kuvu#6270` you will need to reach out to him to appeal the denial.
Yo! I changed my name from Nourouzi to my discord name ISUA,"Feel free to use the ;cn command in <#347885015964712970> , if that doesnt work dm any online security for help"
It looks like I am still suspended...,"Sorry, there are some issues with the bot unsuspending people. If this continues, please contact any security"
so can i get un-banned now that im aware of such rules i will follow them in the future,"Your suspension is for 2 days, if you'd like to appeal it you can reach out to the person that suspended you."
what are the requirements,"Hey, verything you need to know is in <#379504881213374475>"
for the record i did ask rl... would have left if he said no,"Hello, Thank you for letting us know you would have left if asked however apologies for the confusion the raid leader brought to you since there is no leeway for any staff to allow crashing to occur. "
"why did i get a warning, i havent logged into rotmg in 2 months https://i.imgur.com/2fYqBNp.png","hey there sorry about that, parse came up with your name because it was part of someone else's name. ill remove that warn for you rn."
Wondering why I am still suspended,"there's an issue with suspensions being removed right now, you'll be manually unsuspended shortly"
RL SkilledMag mumbled and spoke very quietly and completely fumbled his loc call like 10 times and a bunch of people went to the wrong server,I will let the HRLs know
i got suspended for 2 days until 13 march 2023 and still cant do anything in the server. is it permament ?,"sorry for this error, your suspend will be removed"
can I get un blacklisted as the staff who blacklisted me is no longer blacklisted,"It has been removed, you are free to verify as normal"
Why haven’t I been unbanned even though it’s past the time?,"Hey there chief, the bot has been buggy lately. I’ll unsuspend you now, sorry about that."
"i used supporter but got rtc connecting bug, rl didnt wait. can i refund that supporter usage for this run?","Hey there chief, unfortunately we don't have means to refund that. Luckily you get 10 to use a day! Plenty for any raider :)"
"was in lounge, spent tickets and wasnt dragged in fix the damn bot","You used tickets just as the run started, which is why you weren't dragged in. Make sure to ask an RL to drag you in, if you're in the run and not in vc then it's crashing, even if you used tickets. Unlucky timing, we have given the points back."
"I'm trying to get back into the game after a long break, i am on a new account for a fresh start and i think that might be the issue? I had verified with this discord account on a different rotmg account called Mattchiato but I am now on a new account called Mattcha.","Hey there chief, dm any online security to add an alt account or to verify on a new one"
verify,"Hey, the bot has been having trouble unsuspending people lately. You have been unsuspended, sorry about that."
So I got suspended 2 days ago the suspension was supposed to end ~10 hours ago but I still cannot see any  channels like rsa and so on,"You're unsuspended now, sorry about that. Bot is having issues."
"I had another discord associated with this account but I lost it a long time ago, I would appreciate the effort to change it","Hey mate, DM any online security for assistance."

"'Sayuri | uwu | anya Ran a ADV Cult, I supplied the key, key was modded for fame cults... he did not have any raider control whatsoever, really upsetting that he just let people sit in Troom and activate the boss and enter the hideout and clear before the rest of us could get there. he did mention once for them to not sit in T room but they did not listen, and then he told everyone that its a void run now and to clear MBD. Which they did. They started clearing for void in a cult run.... I mean seriously, I had to ask him to please do the run normal to finally get everyone into the hideout. I have no idea what was going on","That's upsetting to hear, I'll let the HRLs know. Thanks"
"Hi, can i get  unsuspend? My ban just expired today.","Hey, sorry about that sometimes our bot doesn't unsuspend people when it should. You've been unsuspended."

It seems im blacklisted from the discord and the mod that blacklisted me is no longer staff. If I recall correctly I wasnt allowed in last time because my account was too fresh :( It's now been a little over 3 years so I wonder does that still apply,"The blacklist has been removed, feel free to verify as normal"

"I don't know the reason as to why I was blacklisted. I haven't touched this game for a few years and just recently came back.

"I've tried 6 times now to get into a run and hear the RL but noting is happening.

If you make it into the vc good for you. Wait until the Rl says something along the lines of ""If you get moved out, join lounge and hit the reconnect button to get moved back in"".

"I'm ""active"" in the music share channel once in a while and wanted to see if it is okay that I share an album that was recently released. Usually it's no problem, and there's no problem with the actual music as far as I know, but it's from a death metal band and the first word in the band title is the other word for ""unaliving themselves"", I know if I posted the actual word, the automod would delete my message or w/e which is fine. But if I post the spotify album link in the channel it ""should"" bypass that since the link name is just random spam but I don't want it to seem like I am trying to bypass the rules or anything and want to make sure it's okay that I post the link. Again, it just happens to be the band name and I'm not telling anyone to unalive themselves","We're fine with it, the word banned is more towards when its used against someone in a toxic sense. We trust your judgement on that 👍"

"I don’t because my computer can’t handle recording and running raids. But I just figured I’d let you guys know he’s giving loc to his friends, and they aren’t even reacting for early loc or spending tickets like the rest of us.

"Fifty balls is giving early location to his friends for nests and letting them talk in VC during raids. I get that it’s a nest but leaking early loc to friends isn’t cool because people use points for early location and what not and he was trying to lie about it and say his friend used react for early loc when his friends a knight, and that react doesn’t get early location for nests. It’s just unfair to everyone else his friends are getting special treatment. The RL is Fiftyballs and his friends are Fortyballs and Sixtyballs I understand one was former RL but he’s not now so he shouldn’t get special treatment","Hihi, we completely understand where you're coming from and apologize for the negative experience.

"Reye was the RL for a cult. He didn't give much instruction (obviously its a cult so not that hard but still). This included not calling knights to stun slimes, which they weren't.

I have to assume there were no other rls in the call to take over, so I'm not sure what the correct behavior is there.","This is an unfortunate circumstance for sure.

Which is fine and he did get a suspension for it, but the RL proceeded to swear at said peaker for the entirety of the run, was super uncomfortable to be honest. I was key and I did end up removing him from the run mid way through, but even after suspending him and kicking him he proceeded to call him a ""fucking retard"" and a ""monkey"".

"waited for pureons fame cult for half an hour, dm'd my gear and was in lounge but didnt get dragged in","hey there. when it comes to fame cults that Pureon is leading, he tends to be generally selective about the sets that he allows so if he didn't drag you in, it likely means that he didn't think your set was good enough. unfortunately when it comes to vet runs, sets are at the leader's discretion.

"Anyway, just my two cents, have a good day!",Hello hopefully you are doing well. Our VRLS do not always get keys in the vet section so they resort to pinging in RSA. It looks like you don't want to be pinged for that type of stuff. If you check out the <#787200146357354528> channel you can choose what runs you want to be pinged for. Since it was an `@here` ping you simply can turn that off in the server nonifications area while only getting pinged for runs you choose to be pinged for. Hopefully this helps out!

I did a few runs with pierce last night. He just ignored most calls and it made the run very dangerous. He didn't ever call what direction to go in the map so splits were always getting peeked.

"Hey I was in a cultist run on the server. I was however under-req as I had a cc armor on my kensei. A player by the name ""KeyPopSlave"" urged me to leave as this item was not on the req list. I did as asked and left promptly. I then asked under what authority this user had to parse me out of the run (taking as he has no staff or security role on discord). My first question is if this was a valid parse from a non-staff member. However, I began a civilized discussion, with this same player, that my Loch Sheath actually offset the -5 dex from cc armor. However, as reminded by the player, rules are rules (thus why I left when I realized I wasn't meeting the run requirements). Nevertheless, I still tried explaining this to the player, to which he replied with quite an offensive message in Polish. Now, my son was right next to me and he completely read this message (my wife is polish so we all speak polish at home). Needless to say, this message is very disrespectful and most definitely not something my son should be reading. I'll attach a screenshot of said message here. It is to my understanding that this player has gone (without a shadow of doubt) against rule 1 and rule 13. Additionally, depending on my previous question, this player may have also gone against rule 9 by wrongfully parsing me. I'm really disappointed with this behavior's and explaining this to my son was not something me or my wife were happy about.

"it is getting annoying with so many crashers, i make it into vc with early reacts, and crashers take mine and others spots. in addition the RL's will not parse them once they take our spots which seems unfair. rules are here to be followed why shoudlnt i just crash every run with all my guild mates then?","It is unfortunate that there are crashers, but RLs are not required to parse. It is encouraged, but it is the role of security to parse crashers from runs. Often enough, there will be only one RL in a run, which is incredibly dangerous for the RL to solo parse while attempting to lead.

"(because my previous modmail was misunderstood) the point is RLs say ""void arrows dodge up down left right depending on screen rotation"" but not what applies to which screen rotation. So if for standard rotation it's ""dodge up down"" then just say ""dodge up down"". I know how to orient myself, but basically saying, loosely paraphrased ""dodge away from the bullets, direction you're dodging probably depends on screen rotation but it's definitely one of up down left right"" is about as useful as I am to society (which is not very useful)","It has become a common phrase to use over time. So even though you made your point, for now most people can follow the call and dodge in respect to their rotation; they make it through the phase, that's all that matter to us."
"(modmail) in MBC void arrows a standard line is ""void arrows dodge up down left right depending on screen rotation"" but that feels pretty f*cking useless/ambiguous if you don't mention what direction for what screen rotation so might be better if just saying where to dodge if standard screen orientation","all the calls of the fight, not just that one, are based on the default screen rotation. it is expected that you can keep yourself oriented (you can look at minimap if you dont want to reset the rotation). hope this helps"

I personally believe that the nature of most people who nitro boost a server are only boosting because they get them for free with the premium version of nitro, I believe that the server subscribers should receive better benefits than the nitro boosters. Personally I think this should be 5-8 uses of guaranteed spots in a raid per day as opposed to 3.

i want to appeal my blacklist,hey there chief pls contact any online security for some assistance :))
why,"No one hates you (no one even knows who you are if im honest), but make sure to follow the server rules as they apply to everyone. That being said, your suspensions has been analyzed by multiple people (including higher ups) and will not be lifted so it is pointless to try to appeal further. Beware that If you insist on modmailing further from this point (regarding this subject), it will result in you getting blacklisted from modmail."
And if it my key why cant i kick who i want? Is my key not yours,"Keys get logged at the end of a run, not during it. There is no possible justification to kick a raid leader and any raiders without being requested by a RL or security. It seems clear that you do not fully understand the server rules, so it is advised that you read through <#379504881213374475>  and <#482394590721212416>  before joining any more runs. If you have further questions do not hesitate to ask. Happy raiding! (eventually)"
whyyy am i band?????,For kicking rl and other raiders for no reason during a pub halls run
we need them cults,"if you need cults, make sure to dm officer wiggby and he will finally get out of bloody bed and do something on this server"

I don't see an option to use my points for early location on the steamworks raids,"Hi, my apologies, I should have clarified. Dungeons hosted with ViBot are raids in which you *should* be able to spend tickets for early location!"

It will be the last time i pop keys in Lost halls discord,"Well sorry you were put in this situation, but we do not allow our raiders to deafen in the normal raiding section at any point."

"Not to mention all the gross stuff he talked about, like who he would fuck (he said in a very specific and graphic way) and some really weird and random stuff about 2girls1cup, he also kept talking about how he doesn't have nails on his toes because of pus or something like that, really gross stuff, he event kept rambling about that stuff instead of making proper calls like void phases or telling people to lead their shots, counter rotate and stuff that other RLs usually call out",Thank you for the detailed feedback. I'll forward it to the HRL team so that they can deal with it immediately.
why cant i join vc?,Are you reacting in <#379779029479194624> and joining runs when they pop up there.

"Sorry, didn't understand how the system works. I know it's a perma death game and dungeons are difficult, but a death of mine that recently happened in a run could have been avoided if Lumpian was less worried about obs being on a different setting than leading the shatter's run. I'm still learning as I haven't played for a while and haven't done the rework, but unless it was discussed with the group prior to the run, I do think the leader should be focused on minimizing any losses, at least in regular runs (non vet/advanced) and find it frustrating. (written on January 1st, 2023 at around 8:10 PST. I didn't know how the mod mail system works and wasted it on trying to initiate.)",Agreed. I'll make sure to personally forward it to the HRL team that will deal with it accordingly. Thanks for letting us know.

That's fine you can't help that. Have nitro boosted so i can overcome that issue. Now i find at times too many Nitros have reacted so i still miss out. Fair enough you can't have to many places taken up from nitro, that i understand. When i do get my turn it's great (although i have still  once or twice missed out due to crashers because nitro didn't  get early loc.). Now comes the next barrier the 1 hour till able to reuse Nitro.  Maybe i an asking too much, sorry if you feel i am. I just feel  the way Lost Halls views and uses nitro boosting is very little benefit and not the value it should be. I like Lost Halls as a Server don't get me wrong it's 1 of my top 2.  Just during big events i find other servers more usable and worthwhile. Thanks for taking the time to read this.","Hi, we're sorry for the inconvenience that this has caused you.

Also weird flexing over kudosubi's newly found ability to suspend people, said 'if I'm in a douchebag mood I'll suspend you and laugh about it' which was strange but a lot more on the funny side than the sexual harassment.

Otherwise if there are patterns of this false removal then it should be looked into.","Hiya! Thank you for contacting modmail, it seems that a mistake was indeed made. We shall notify him and make sure it doesn't happen again, have a nice day! 🙂"

Carsrcool let in like 12 people into a raid. probably not all keys/vial,"Aside from keys and vials, there are a few other reacts which get early location/priority into vc. A maximum of 1 armor break, 1 expose, 3 vials, 5 ticket users, and 5 nitro users can be given priority into vc. This also does not include the key or any staff members who may be joining the run. So while it seems like a lot, everyone in vc early was bringing something or using a perk of the server"
exi#7470 and NNJUNICORN#1048 amazing raid leaders both lead some of the fastest void runs I've been in!,"Thank you for sharing your positive experience with us, we hope to keep the run quality at the highest level at all times, so we will forward it to the HRL team."
"RL ""OwnUEasy"" put up a headcount and then raid for a void. After hitting multiple pot rooms he then decided that we would do cult even though 38/48 raiders said they didn't want to do cult. He then said it didn't matter and we would do cult regardless. Unsure why RL decides he does whatever he wants and we are doing a cult instead of void even though the run put up was a void.","Thanks for sharing this, it will be forwarded to the HRL team immedietly."
"i just change my name ig, do i need to verify it again to do runs?","hello, you can go to <#347885015964712970> and do ;cn *newname* if you have everything public on realmeye (newname = your new nickname)"
"you too, merry christmas 👍",<3
"it was in a skipz run, pretty sure he unmuted them to chat","thank you for bringing this to our attention, have a good christmas"
"i think their ign was chevelle or something, not entirely sure","that user is a trial raid leader, they would not be able to unmute. was it skipz perhaps?"
"about 2 hours ago someone said this in vc (don't think it was the rl), was a cult run. they said ""everyone should try it (drink driving) once"", which i don't think is very appropriate",do you know what member of staff did this?
"i dont think encouraging drink driving (even as a ""joke"") is a good idea!","hello there, could you elaborate on this please? is this a comment on something that a member of staff has said? or are you just letting us know to not encourage drink driving"
I already did and they havent replied in over 72 hours,"He has been informed to reply to you, if he doesnt within the next 24 hours feel free to Dm any other security online at that time"
OKIE DADDY,O.O
"Name Chevelle, kept calling wrong stuff or nothing at all, not reading chat messages at all, not reacting to the group, and before mbd some ppl got separated by a crusade, calling the crusade multiple times with caps in chat and shit and he just either did not react or not give a fuck.",Sorry you had a bad experience but thank you for your feedback. I will pass it on to the hrl team
I want to complain about an rl,"Hi, who was the RL and what was the issue?"
I'm here to wish good luck to Voodi with other modmails he might receive after the scuffed void run no one went over to the right side lmao,dont worry we dont ever actually read modmail we just laugh at it <:KEKW:628835645783146507>
I have screenshots for proof if necesarry,Message <@236958022696435713> to appeal your suspension. If you however feel like he doesn't handle the case fairly you may also message an Officer.
;kudosubi is a goated rl. There were 2 instances during a void run where things started to look sketchy and it came together purely from his calls 👍,thank you for your feedback :)

"the runs are good fun, all good vibes","Thats good to hear, thank you for the feedback!"
He has a very energetic personality,How are the runs that he is doing? I can see that you're using multiple keys in his runs so im guessing you're enjoying them.
Very Energetic,"I'm assuming this is about Voodi, can you go into more detail please?"
"Yeah Voodi's run was just straight unprofessional. like all the wrong calls, all super late, and people died because of it. He spent half the time laughing during survival.","Sorry to hear about this, this will be passed on to the HRL team."
"So I have a question regarding trading. I would like to buy a fools prism, but I was wondering if I would be punished or if it's against the server rules if I offered to buy/pop keys of choice. Thanks","As long as its not rwt you're fine, you can always look at the pinned messages to see the rules of the channel."
Feetpics | toepLcs the trial raid leader was super aggressive and toxic after being told to make calls,"Sorry about this, this will be forwarded to the HRL team. Thank you."
mod mail for feet pics- Good Calls Good Runs Fun Runs Prolly one of the best rls in the server,"Good to hear that you're enjoying his runs, thank you for the feedback."
Why am I blacklisted? I have not played in 2 years and I come back blacklisted! This was one of my most used discords. 😦,Reach out to any online security member and they'll be able to assist you with your verification
Good & funny  person in general and enjoyed his raid leading more than other ones,"I’m glad you are enjoying his raids, thank you for the feedback."
"ign: feetpics - very good rl, always fun his raids/voids/everything,","That’s great, glad to hear you are having a good time in his raids!"
feetpics good rl,That’s good to hear! What about his runs made them stand out?
"Omg I love cansonio, based RL and the runs were very pog!!!! promotion when?",Damn right bro 🙂
"the RLs ""hm""' and ""tap""' did a couple shatters yesterday gave no class, and just messed around even during a hard mode which ended up failing","Thank you for letting us know, this will be passed into the HRL team."
"Hello, my verification got denied from lost halls and I was wondering  which step I got wrong?",You'll need to message *Eichhorst to get more information on your verification.
Those are all the details. Thank you for your diligence!,Better to dm anyone with the giveaways role than send it here
He's very attractive!,"Gonna have to agree with you there, he’s exceptionally cute. We’ll make sure the HRLs know how attractive he is, thank you."
Tap is very awesome!,We’re very happy you think positively of Tap! Is there anything specific you really like about him? And feedback is appreciated. :)
"Hi mod team, i need a mod to manually verify me cuz trying to use the  ""use this code and put in realmeue desc"" dosen't work",You need to put the code that the bot sends you in your realmeye description.
can you help me transfer my LH verification to this account?,DM any online security and they will help you.
"Hello there mod mail people, I just wanted to mention that I was doing a raid for an ice tomb. I did everything properly. I waited patiently for the 5 second count down to then spam join the call, which I did end up getting in to. Only problem is that my discord was for some reason only playing the sound effect of people joining/leaving calls, could not hear the rl. So quickly went to go grab myself some headphones to try to fix the problem, which worked. I then dmed the rl if he had called location yet, as I couldnt hear my discord prior. (completely harmless question) The rl then proceeds to say stuff about how annoying people keep dming him to ask for early location, and that he doesnt care about deaf people more specifically ""i have no sympathy for deaf people"". RL says all this stuff simply from me just asking if he had called location or not yet. simple yes/no answer and he starts to be just very toxic overall. Rl was kudosubi.",Sorry to hear. This will be passed onto the hrl team
"That's my actual ign, I know I verified the name on a different discord account, I was wondering if I could switch to this one","Yo sorry about that, 99% of our staff team is 12 year old boys. Feel free to dm any security to get this changed."
I know that person he was great at giving speeches,"I too know that person, he did give some great speeches"
Lplp can take this L,WTF UNBLACKLIST ME NOW
